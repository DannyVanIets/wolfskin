# SCENE 35-39

    ed "I retired to the bedroom after Uldin's story about the werewolf attack. I couldn't take much more of it. Afterwards, I fell into a deep and dreamless sleep."

    ed "I first noticed the wolfskin was gone when I heard the scream. I smelled the faint scent of perfume, so I figured it was Salome."

    il "Did you hear me knocking on your door?"

    ed "I was still inside. I heard Kellac's voice, so I didn't answer. I couldn't risk opening the door with my arms transformed."

    il "So, when Kellac and I moved to seek help, you moved to the master bedroom."

    ed "Yes. If the wolfskin had been taken, I thought it would be there. At the time, I was worried for my own life. "

    ed "When I broke down the door, Salome was barely conscious. The room was full of smoke and ash. She still had some lycan features: fangs, and claws… "

    ed "Her voice was thin, high and frail. Her body seemed so small, like it was burned away."

    ed "I asked for the wolfskin back. She ignored my plea and with the last of her strength, begged me to kill her."

    il "How did you do it? Kellac ruled her death as complications from her burn wounds."

    ed "I tried to think of the most merciful way to give her peace. By then, I truly did pity her - we suffered the same curse, and I felt my sorrow in her."

    ed "I held her close and crushed the bones in her neck, hoping for an instant death."

    il "You're certain you killed her? She wasn’t already dead before that?"

    ed "When a bearer of the wolfskin dies, they revert to human form. She no longer had any bestial features when I was done."

    il "And then when you were trying to search for the wolfskin, we found you."

    ed "Yes. How it moved to the chest in Salome's room, I don't know."

    "Ilona and Edwin fall silent. Even though he had killed Salome, he was not the one who orchestrated the murder on Uldin."

    il "Fleur still hasn't been found. People fear she's actually been kidnapped, or taken by the fae."

    ed "Do you think that's true?"

    il "During the murder, her location was not accounted for. Part of me believes she's more than just a witness."

    ed "Then you think she may be an accomplice… Or, if she were the murderer… Hmm…"

    "Edwin considers this for a moment."

    ed "She could do it, if she wore the wolfskin."

    ed "But if she truly is lost, she'd be suffering the same effects that I did. It's excruciating to go through."

    ed "When I was first given the wolfskin, I foolishly tried to part with it and leave it behind. In retribution for not obeying the curse, I was left howling in pain."

    ed "If she's still missing and was the murderer, she'd need to have incredible fortitude to remain silent for all this time."

    il "Then maybe Fleur was an accomplice, even unwillingly? I strongly believe that she helped Salome."

    ed "That's probably the safest assumption, unless she is found."

    il "If only we had stayed together and were honest with ourselves…"

    ed "No. If they wanted the wolfskin while we were together, they might have killed you to get to it. It would have been very easy to make me look guilty of that."

    ed "Maybe it's better that it happened this way - both of us separated."

    il "Let's not think about that now. I'm involved in this as much as you are now."

    ed "Ilona, listen to me. The people here… They like you. I was going to suggest it to you in the morning, when we saw each other again."

    ed "You… You should stay here. Live, and survive."

    il "And watch you {i}die{/i}? Do you really think I would be happy with something like that?"

    ed "I'm going to get what's coming to me, sooner or later."

    ed "Your hurt and pain will heal. You can recover. If you're with me, you can't walk a righteous path. But if you leave me here, at least one of us can survive."

    il "Enough!{p}I already accepted that when I left the priory with you!"

    # Ilona is crying.

    il "I'm not trying to find a way to break your curse so I can return to the priory, or to repent for my sins."

    il "I'm doing it so we can live together without the constant fear of being hunted down!"

    ed "I-Ilona… You really want…"

    il "I can't do that if you're going to offer yourself up to be killed."

    "Edwin goes to reach for her face, but pauses. He slips off his glove first, and brushes away Ilona's tears with his thumb."

    ed "Then we need to survive and break the curse, so that I can take you back to meet my family."

    "He smiles warmly at her. Her tears subside as he wipes them away. She touches the hand at her cheek, finally laughing lightly at his comment."

    il "Don't say things like that yet. We need to figure out a plan first. You have your wolfskin back, so you could easily break through the chains… We could escape."

    ed "It'll be difficult… but I can try. The walls are high, but I could scale them if I transform. If you survey the town's layout, and find a part of the wall that could give me some footing, that would help us."

    il "Understood. I should go — someone might be searching for me."

# SCENE 40

    "Ilona ties the chains around Edwin again. His possession of the wolfskin should remain a secret until the time comes to escape, and he partially transforms to appear as he did before."

    "Once confirming that nobody is at the door to the dungeon, she exits outside. The door to the dungeon shuts with a metallic groan."

    "The wind howls, and she draws her nun's habit closer to her body. The ruins of the chapel loomed towards her, as though the remaining structure would threaten to collapse."

    an "What are you doing here, Ilona? Are you now praying for help?"

    "Ilona's heart leaps when she hears Anari speak so suddenly."

    il "… Sure, I was. I was praying for your success in finding Fleur. Did you find her yet?"

    an "No, but there's still time before sundown. We'll search the forest. There was another important job I had to oversee."

    il "What might that be?"

    an "Making sure there's enough firewood to build a pyre."

    il "…!"

    an "Edwin is a pretty big man. Wouldn't it be terrible to burn him at the stake, but leave the job half-finished? And he can turn into a werewolf… That's going to take a lot of fuel."

    il "Honestly, I wonder if you're really the monster instead."

    an "Relax, I'm just being prepared for any situation. How about you, did you find anything about the real murderer?"

    il "You shouldn't let your guard down; I have a better understanding of the situation now."

    an "Good. This should be entertaining."

    "With that remark, Anari leaves. In the remaining time, Ilona reconvenes with Kellac. Eisleigh's condition is now stable and she is resting, the bleeding ceased."

    "As part of the investigation, Ilona and Kellac join the search party for Fleur. While doing so, Ilona searches for an escape route, and any part of the wall that may look like it could be scaleable."

    "Eventually, Kellac takes his leave to watch over Eisleigh, to make sure her condition remains stable; leaving Ilona in the town square."

# SCENE 40

    "The day grows darker, and the sky is bathed in gold as the sun dips below the horizon. Edwin is brought out from the dungeon, his wolf-like arms bound in chains."

    "Anari is waiting, and several of the townsfolk look to the pyre stacked in the middle of the town square. There is an air of formality surrounding her, clad in her red hunting garments. They seem even more vibrant, illuminated by the glow of the sun."

    an "We will begin the proceedings against Edwin, who has been apprehended this morning."

    an "The claims against the accused are that he is both a monster and a murderer."

    an "He has made his companionship with the nun, Ilona, clear; who has been harboring him with the knowledge that he is a werewolf."

    an "As many of you heard, the master of the town, Uldin, and his wife, Salome, have been killed. Their daughter, Fleur, has gone missing. The found one on scene is Edwin."

    an "I'll start first with some important information. We could not locate Fleur, but we found this in the forest. When we found it, the seal on it was still intact."

    an "Anari's face is grim. She pulls out a letter, the seal on it broken. She reads the brief message out loud for all to hear."

    "{i}By the time you receive this letter, I will be reunited with who I consider to be my true family.{/i}"

    "{i}I could only choose one or the other, and so I have decided to take a test of faith to prove my worthiness: I will strike terror into the one who has abandoned me.{/i}"

    "{i}In doing so, I have let fate decide my hand, and this was the result - to reunite me with the fair ones forevermore.{p}- Fleur Belorovna{/i}"

    an "It's confirmed to be in her hand-writing."

    an "Fleur is… no longer with us. She has been taken by the fair folk. During the search, we could not find even her footprints, or any clues towards her disappearance."

    an "…{p}With that matter settled, let's proceed with Edwin. The nun Ilona has prepared a defence. Please, rise."

# SCENE 41

    "The words were stuck in Ilona's throat. She thinks deeply about the contents of Fleur's letter, but it truly sounds like the young girl mysteriously vanished."

    "{i}I could only choose one or the other, and so I have decided to take a test of faith to prove my worthiness.{/i}"

    "Ilona decides that they should at least begin with what they know from the investigation, and think about Fleur's letter along the way."

    il "This murder had at least two conspirators involved: Salome and Fleur."

    an "Hoh? Go on."

    il "Both Salome and Fleur conspired together to drug the guests at the banquet, by poisoning the sugar with a powerful soporific."

    il "This was given to Uldin by Kellac last night as part of his medicine to aid his sleeplessness. Kellac has confirmed three doses of this medicine are gone."

    il "During the banquet, Fleur and Salome were able to figure out Edwin's true nature, and thought to drug him by lacing the sugar with the soporific. When Edwin was asleep, they were able to steal a cursed item from him, and assume the form of a werewolf."

    an "I'll spare you the details on motivation for why these two would want to murder their beloved Uldin, or you'll surely run wild with some strange story. Thank me later."

    an "I'm more interested on how this was done. So? Who was the one that murdered Uldin?"

    "Ilona thinks carefully about the course of events, and what she really saw."

    "(The corpse of Salome, burned beyond recognition… )"

    "(Her voice was thin, high and frail. Her body seemed smaller, possibly due to the burns…)"

    "(“She could do it, if she wore the wolfskin.”)"

    "A theory appears before her, dispelling the illusion of what she saw. If she is right, then this would explain the tragedy of last night in its entirety."

    il "How could we identify the burned corpse in the Master's chamber?"

    an "It was difficult, but she was wearing Salome's effects, and her hair looked to be worn in the same way."

    il "Did Salome have any identifying features on her body? Anything that could be used to set her apart?"

    an "Nothing that I know of, apart from the mole near her eye… And her face has been horribly burned — "

    il "Then, here's my answer for who murdered Uldin: the culprit was Fleur. {p}The corpse of Salome has been misidentified."

    an "What? Do you mistrust Kellac's judgement? We've known Salome for so long, and yet you make this bold claim — this better not be some convenient excuse!"

    il "The corpse's face, hair and body was burned to an unrecognizable state. The only identifiers we had were the ring of Salome’s, and her dress - all clothing and effects."

    il "In actuality, it is Fleur's body."

    an "So, we might have mistaken the identity of the corpse. But why Fleur? Did she have a reason for patricide?"

    il "This information is still new to me… But she's the only one who has presented any real motivation. Her letter read: I will strike terror into the one who has abandoned me."

    il "Fleur's letter talks about choosing between who is her true family. Uldin is not frequently in this town, is he not? He has essentially abandoned his daughter."

    il "Only the guests were targeted to be drugged that night — but not Uldin, nor herself or her mother. She needed him awake to scare him. As luck would have it, Edwin had the cursed item needed for transformation into a werewolf."

    il "Her mother was assisting her in this plot. Fleur never intended to kill, she only wished to scare Uldin, perhaps to convince him to change his behaviour."

    il "She assumed the form of a werewolf, Uldin's worst fear."

    il "She wore her mother's dress and ring, perhaps to avoid suspicion if found wandering at night… Or to further intensify his fear if she wore those items transformed. As you know, Fleur is fond of pranks and tricks. What better night than All Hallow's Eve?"

    an "I refuse to believe this… This is all far too absurd."

    il "A werewolf has considerable strength, even more than a beast, but it doesn't make you impervious to all attack."

    il "In retaliation of seeing such a horrible sight, Uldin did not hesitate to burn Fleur, and in rage, she killed him by biting his throat."

    il "You may have believed she was taken by the fair folk, but this would explain why you were unable to find her; or even to glimpse any trace of her - she was already dead."

    an "Let's say this is true. How do you explain Fleur's letter? The wooden effigy of her that appeared in her bed?"

    il "As I said, there was more than one conspirator, and therefore an accomplice. Even if Edwin did not have a cursed item, Salome could be assured that a monster in her house was sedated. And I strongly believe that she encouraged Fleur to do this 'prank' on her father."

    il "Salome must have entered the room after the howl, and she let out a scream at the sight of both Uldin and Fleur's wounds. She took the cursed item stolen from Edwin, and hid in the room before we entered."

    il "She waited patiently until the manse was empty. After we escorted Edwin to the dungeon and gathered in the town square, Salome was able to move again. She locked the wolfskin away in a chest in her room, and trapped it with a device."

    il "Salome placed the statue in Fleur's bed to make it seem like she was spirited away by the fair folk. This statue fits the description of this receipt I found in Salome's room. Here."

    "Ilona hands Anari the paper she found in the chest. Upon realizing that it explains the existence wooden statue of Fleur, she looks thoroughly displeased, nearly crumpling the document."

    il "Fleur must have had some suspicion this plan was risky, so she wrote a short letter. If she succeeded in her prank, all she had to do was destroy it."

    il "In fact, since the letter was found still sealed, I would suspect Salome encouraged Fleur to write it. To make Fleur's disappearance seem more credible, she placed it in the forest after her escape."

    il "The one that orchestrated the plan was Salome, and she is the survivor."

# SCENE 42

    "Ilona’s proposition is met with mumblings, grumblings, dissatisfied grunts and a few voices of support from the townsfolk. However, it’s all drowned out in the eyes and minds of both Ilona and Anari-"

    "Ilona is shivering, as the warm rays of sun accentuate the bags under her eyes. Tired. Broken. But still standing."

    "It’s impossible to say what Anari might be thinking right now. Her posture unflinching, the totality of her being in complete focus. She asks the crowd to simmer down, her usual aura of conceit fading away."

    "There is now only one question that remains-and a clocktower that's ticking away, endlessly."

    an "Let me ask you: where is Salome?"

    il "That, I can't tell you. I'm certain that my theory is correct, though."

    il "I do not care what happens next, Anari. Whether you believe me or not is irrelevant. I've only tried to make sense of what I could from this tragedy."

    il "You cannot make me feel guilt for harbouring Edwin as a werewolf. He is not defined by his curse, and I want you to see that."

    il "I have provided evidence and my theory, as you asked. Nothing I do now can change your mind. I accept it, regardless of the outcome."

    an "Nun, I would like to believe you. More than anyone else, believe it or not. As to why I feel that way…"

    an "Well, maybe I can tell you some other time. If we even get a chance that is. In your mind, you may be right..."

    an "But unless you bring me Salome, you can't convince me. The ‘righteousness’ that you preach of is meaningless without tangible proof. So, where is Salome? We searched everywhere in this town for her daughter."

    il "I can only speculate at this point. I don't know if Belorov has any secret or hidden passages."

    an "That would be far too convenient, wouldn't it? Perhaps I’m misguided, but I’ve had far, far too many repercussions for trusting people in the past. In more ways than you can ever imagine."

    an "If I am wrong, so be it. When my time comes, I’ll gladly accept my penance."

    an "There's one thing that's certain: your arrival into this town brought with it the destruction of this family."

    an "If it weren't for you and Edwin, this tragedy would never have happened."

    il "You're blaming us for being caught in a plot that was using us? For all I know, you were always looking for a reason to kill Edwin. Maybe you planned for this to happen, to usurp power in Belorov."

    an "Hahahahaha! How amusing. I don't desire that in the least."

    an "You should choose your words more wisely, nun. It's unbecoming of a holy woman… but I knew you were a heretic from the first moment I saw you. The truth is, I never intended for you to win."

    "With a signal of Anari's hand, two town guards move in on Ilona and grip her arms tightly; drawing them behind her back. The men tried to bind Ilona's hands together with thick rope."

    il "Aaaaaaaahh! Let me go!"

    "Ilona struggles and tries to shake the men off, but the guards do not relent. One grabs her by the hair. Edwin cannot abide by this any longer. He transforms, the chains snapping off him as he transforms into a massive wolf-man."

    "He rushes at the guards with a growl, knocking them over by slamming against them. He throws them off with both fang and claw, prying Ilona away from them."

    "Anari did not expect this development. She strings her bow, and takes an arrow from her quiver. She trains it on the werewolf."

    an "I won't let you escape."

    "When she releases the bowstring, a piercing, otherworldly whistle cries out from her weapon. It misses. The arrow grazes Edwin's fur as he transforms from half-man, half-wolf, into an enormous grey wolf."

    "He continues to run on all fours, with only Ilona to guide him. She adjusts herself on his back, grasping tufts of thick fur. Anari scowls, and then goes to climb a tower to gain a higher vantage point."

    il "The guards will have closed the gates. There's a part of the wall that has been rebuilt with jagged stones. That can give you more of a footing."

    "Edwin takes a running leap, and latches his claws into the stone wall. He shifts back into his half-wolf form and starts climbing."

# SCENE 44

    "The looming stone wall in front of them is a substantial hurdle to overcome. The town guards mobilise, firing arrows that torrent Edwin and Ilona. Edwin does his best to throw off their aim."

    "There is one he cannot escape from. Anari's skill with a bow is frightening, her gaze ever calm and steady."

    "Two arrows finally meet its target. They pierce his side, fired in rapid succession. Then three more pierce his ribs. This isn’t a problem for the werewolf, as he brushes aside the pain. He’s taken greater beatings  than this."

    "However, he’s not invincible; a few more well placed shots and he’s down, along with Ilona."

    il "Stay with me Edwin! Don’t lose sight of our escape. I’ll do my best to heal your wounds with- {w}Ah!"

    "An arrow pierces the hand with which Ilona was trying to use to heal. Her hand twists and contorts, reflexingly convulsing due to the writhing pain."

    ed "Ilona! Ho-hold on, we’re almost there!"

    "Time seems to move too slowly. How much more pain can they accept? Edwin grimaces past the pain of his sustained wounds."

    "There’s no question about it - Ilona knows Anari could never miss her mark, not with a target so large. She’s missing their vitals on purpose."

    "A good look at Anari leaves nothing more than questions.{p}Does she want to let them leave?{p}Or capture and burn them at the stake alive?"

    "Her intentions remain unclear, as one final arrow impales Ilona in the back, shooting through her cleanly."

    "With a light scream, Ilona loses her footing. There's only one hand she could use to hold onto the rough stone wall, and her fingers are slipping. Blood stains her white dress from the hole it left behind, and she can feel it drip down on the wall."

    ed "Ilona! No!"

    "Edwin is quick to react, as he pulls her over while climbing over the wall; carrying her carefully, as though holding an injured bird."

    "The stone wall they escaped over is dyed red with their blood. Yet they make it out of Belorov, despite their injuries."

    # Scene 46 - the voice direction here should sound a little slower than usual to reflect their injuries.

    "Edwin marches on, with Ilona in his arms. It’s too dangerous to be out in the open. They search for a place to rest, as dusk greets them with open arms."

    "Ilona heals the wound that pierced her abdomen through, and the blood slows. However, the wound does not close completely. The other arrows stuck in them would prove more dangerous to deal with, with no surgical equipment to use."

    il "Edwin, set me down. You're more injured than I am."

    ed "Ilona, my darling-"

    il "{i}Darling?{/i}"

    "At the awkward exchange, Edwin gingerly sets Ilona down on the ground. He reverts to human form, his ears and face red. Ilona tries to heal what open wounds that Edwin has."

    ed "Yes, I've —  I’ve been waiting to call you that for so long."

    ed "What a fool I was to keep what I felt about you hidden, because you were a nun…"

    ed "The time I spent without you, in that cell. It was excruciating. And that’s when I realised, {w}how much I want you by my side."

    il "My, the exhaustion must be getting to you."
    extend " Now I know you weren't joking about wanting me to meet your family…"

    ed "…"

    il "In all seriousness, thank you. It- it means a lot to me."
    extend " Could we rest for a while?"

    ed "I don't hear anyone pursuing us. Just for a moment…"

    "They walk for a while, seeing the valley unfold before them. Eventually, they stop to sit under the shade of a tree, basking in its shadow. Their breath is ragged, but in sync with each other's. Ilona rests her head on Edwin’s shoulders."

    ed "I’m sorry."

    il "About what?"

    ed "You’re right about me not saying what it is that I want to say, burying it so deep within the abyss that I can’t even reach it."

    # watch the wait and pauses for some of these lines.

    ed "Even if I want to…"
    extend "...And just maybe, if I’d come clean to the people that we came across,"
    extend "and to you, about the wolfskin; the incessant nightmares that I’ve been having...."

    ed "I couldn't even trust you to watch me transform..."

    il "It’s okay. We can start over."

    ed "If I’d had the courage to ask for your assistance, we could have found an alternative."

    il "We must be strong and keep our past behind us. What’s done is done."

    il "Besides, I’m here for you now."
    extend " And you are for me."
    extend " I’m sure that God will not send another trial to test our resolve."

    ed "I would like to believe that."

    "Edwin and Ilona stay silent, listening to the breathing of the other. They both feared when they would only hear silence, and so the grievous wounds would prove that they were alive."

    ed "Why must the cycle of violence perpetuate? Wherever I go, something always goes wrong."

    ed "I’ve noticed hints of it. Even in these past few days - mind you, that banquet was all too much for me to begin with. I used to enjoy these things, but now, I..."

    il " I know."

    ed "It felt like everybody there had something to hide, and doubts arose from that… We were all turning against each other."

    ed "Why hide? I know I’m in no position to say this, but I see the absurdity of it all now. It does no good."

    il "I guess it's hard sometimes. Especially when you have no one you can trust,"
    extend " nobody to confide in."

    il "And you’re all alone, because you always second guess intentions… There’s nothing worse than feeling utterly alone."

    ed "Is that why Salome did what she did?"

    il "I do not know, but I pity her…"

    # at this point, the voices should have more pauses in between them, and gradually slow and quieten down to reflect a death scene.

    "Ilona hears Edwin's breathing slow. Ilona is too weary to use any more healing magic. They can’t remove the arrows that pierced them, or the two of them would surely bleed out and die."

    ed "…"

    il "Edwin?"

    ed "…"

    il "Ed…"

    ed "Yes, love. I'm still here. What is it?"

    il "Is it okay if I close my eyes for a while?"
    extend " I don’t think I’ll be able to hold out for any longer…"

    ed "You may. I'll keep watch, so you can rest."

    il "I wonder — what your family is like…"

    ed "It's a big family… They'll definitely welcome you…"

    il "That sounds… nice…"

    "Edwin watches the brilliance of the sky and clouds, gradually darkening. With Ilona by his side, he relishes in the peace and comfort."

    ed "Ilona, love…"

    il "I'm here. Did you need anything?"

    ed "I-I just…"
    extend " I just wanted to say that I’m indebted to you."

    il "You're always thanking me…"
    extend " Ed…"

    ed "Yes?"

    il "Do you think you could hold me? I want to lie down…"

    ed "Of course… I'll lie down with you. We should be safe here…"

    il "Thank you…"

    "Ilona lays her head against Edwin's chest, and he gently wraps his arms around her. He heaves a contented sigh, yet the arrows piercing him dig into his weary body."

    "Edwin thinks of the time they met, reading aloud poetry and ballads together. He strokes her hair, speaking softly in a murmur. He can feel his hands wet with the blood from her wounds."

    # despite the beautiful poem, it should be delivered clumsily and slowly with pauses, as though struggling to think of the next line, and also struggling for breath if possible.

    ed "Should our journey end, so just it be."
    extend " I am lost no more, I lay to rest."

    ed "The sun bestows its blessings over me,"
    extend " While you wait beside."

    # pronunciation of verdure - vur-jur
    ed "I flourish with the bountiful verdure,"

    ed "Though words are withering,"
    extend " In all uncertainty we usher"
    extend " I bid you know: I love you."
