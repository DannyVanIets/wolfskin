# SCENE 35-39

    ed "I retired to the bedroom after Uldin's tale. I couldn't take much more of it. Afterwards, I fell into a deep and dreamless sleep."

    ed "I first noticed the wolfskin was gone when I heard the scream. I smelled the faint scent of Salome's perfume."

    il "Did you hear me knocking on your door?"

    ed "I was still inside. I heard Kellac's voice, so I didn't answer. I couldn't risk opening the door with my arms transformed."

    il "So, when Kellac and I moved to seek help, you moved to the master bedroom."

    ed "Yes. If the wolfskin had been taken, I thought it would be there. At the time, I was worried for my own life. "

    ed "When I broke down the door, Salome was barely conscious. The room was full of smoke and ash. She still had some lycan features: fangs, and claws… "

    ed "Her voice was thin, high and frail. Her body seemed so small, like it was burned away."

    ed "I asked for the wolfskin back. She ignored my plea and with the last of her strength, begged me to kill her."

    il "How did you do it? Kellac ruled her death as complications from her burn wounds."

    ed "I tried to think of the most merciful way to give her peace. By then, I truly did pity her - we suffered the same curse, and I felt my sorrow in her."

    ed "I held her close and crushed the bones in her neck, hoping for an instant death."

    il "You're certain you killed her? She wasn’t already dead before that?"

    ed "When a bearer of the wolfskin dies, they revert to human form. She no longer had any bestial features when I was done."

    il "And then when you were trying to search for the wolfskin, we found you."

    ed "Yes. How it moved to the chest in Salome's room, I don't know."

    "Ilona and Edwin fall silent. Even though he had killed Salome, he was not the one who orchestrated the murder on Uldin."

    il "Fleur still hasn't been found. People fear she's actually been spirited away."

    ed "Do you think that's true?"

    il "During the murder, her location was not accounted for. Part of me believes she's more than just a witness."

    ed "Then you think she may be an accomplice… Or, if she were the murderer…"

    ed "She could do it, if she wore the wolfskin."

    ed "But without the wolfskin on her, she'd be suffering the same effects that I did. It's excruciating to go through."

    ed "When I first tried to get rid of the wolfskin, after I had been cursed with it, I was left howling in pain."

    ed "If she's still missing and was the murderer, she'd need to have incredible fortitude to remain silent for all this time."

    il "Then maybe… an accomplice, even unwillingly? I strongly believe that she helped Salome."

    ed "That's probably the safest assumption, unless she is found."

    il "If only we had stayed together and were honest with ourselves…"

    ed "No. If they wanted the wolfskin while we were together, they might have killed you to get to it. It would have been very easy to make me look guilty of that."

    ed "Maybe it's better that it happened this way - both of us separated."

    il "Let's not think about that now. I'm involved in this as much as you are now."

    ed "Ilona, listen to me. The people here… They like you. I was going to suggest it to you in the morning, when we saw each other again."

    ed "You… You should stay here. Live, and survive."

    il "And watch you die? Do you really think I would be happy with something like that?"

    ed "I'm going to get what's coming to me, sooner or later."

    ed "Your hurt and pain will heal. You can recover. If you're with me, you can't walk a righteous path. But if you leave me here, at least one of us can survive."

    il "Enough!{p}I already accepted that when I left the priory with you!"

    il "I'm not trying to find a way to break your curse so I can return to the priory, or to repent for my sins."

    il "I'm doing it so we can live together without the constant fear of being hunted down!"

    ed "I-Ilona… You really want…"

    il "I can't do that if you're going to offer yourself up to be killed."

    "Edwin goes to reach for her face, but pauses. He slips off his glove first, and brushes away Ilona's tears with his thumb."

    ed "Then we need to survive and break the curse, so that I can take you back to meet my family."

    "He smiles warmly at her. Her tears subside as he wipes them away. She touches the hand at her cheek, finally laughing lightly at his comment."

    il "Don't say things like that yet. We need to figure out a plan first. You have your wolfskin back, so you could easily break through the chains… We could escape."

    ed "It'll be difficult… but I can try. The walls are high, but I could scale them if I transform. I need you to survey the town layout and find something we could use."

    il "Understood. I should go — someone might be searching for me."

# SCENE 40

    "Ilona ties the chains around Edwin again. His possession of the wolfskin should remain a secret until the time comes to escape."

    "Once confirming that nobody is at the door to the dungeon, she exits outside. The door to the dungeon shuts with a metallic groan."

    "The wind howls, and she draws her nun's habit closer to her body. The ruins of the chapel loomed towards her, as though the remaining structure would threaten to collapse."

    an "What are you doing here, Ilona? Are you now praying for help?"

    "Ilona's heart leaps when she hears Anari speak so suddenly."

    il "… Sure, I was. I was praying for your success in finding Fleur. Did you find her yet?"

    an "No, but there's still time before sundown. We'll search the forest. There was another important job I had to oversee."

    il "What might that be?"

    an "Making sure there's enough firewood to build a pyre."

    il "…!"

    an "Edwin is a pretty big man. Wouldn't it be terrible to burn him at the stake, but leave the job half-finished? And he can turn into a werewolf… That's going to take a lot of fuel."

    il "You truly are a monster."

    an "Relax, I'm just being prepared for any situation. How about you, did you find anything about the real murderer?"

    il "I have a better understanding of the situation now."

    an "Good. This should be entertaining."

    "With that remark, Anari leaves. In the remaining time, Ilona reconvenes with Kellac. Eisleigh's condition is now stable and she is resting, the bleeding ceased."

    "Ilona and Kellac investigate the town, as part of the search party for Fleur. While doing so, Ilona searches for an escape route, and anything else they could use to their advantage."

    "Eventually, Kellac takes his leave to watch over Eisleigh, to make sure her condition remains stable; leaving Ilona in the town square."

# SCENE 40

    "The day grows darker, and the sky is bathed in gold as the sun dips below the horizon. Edwin is brought out from the dungeon, his wolf-like arms bound in chains."

    "Anari is waiting, and several of the townsfolk look to the pyre stacked in the middle of the town square. There is an air of formality surrounding her, clad in her red hunting garments. They seem even more vibrant, illuminated by the glow of the dying sun."

    an "We will begin the proceedings against Edwin, who has been apprehended this morning."

    an "The claims against the accused are that he is both a monster and a murderer."

    an "He has made his companionship with the nun, Ilona, clear; who has been harboring him with the knowledge that he is a werewolf."

    an "As many of you heard, the master of the town, Uldin, and his wife, Salome, have been killed. Their daughter, Fleur, has gone missing. The found one on scene is Edwin."

    an "I'll start first with some important information. We could not locate Fleur, but we found this in the forest."

    an "Anari's face is grim. She pulls out a letter, the seal on it broken. She reads the brief message out loud for all to hear."

    "{i}By the time you receive this letter, I will be reunited with who I consider to be my true family.{/i}"

    "{i}I could only choose one or the other, and so I have decided to take a test of faith to prove my worthiness: I will strike terror into the one who  has abandoned me.{/i}"

    "{i}In doing so, I have let fate decide my hand, and this was the result - to reunite me with the fair ones forevermore.{p}- Fleur Belorovna{/i}"

    an "It's confirmed to be in her hand-writing."

    an "Fleur is… lost to this world. During the search, we could not find even her footprints, or any clues towards her disappearance."

    an "…{p}With that matter settled, let's proceed with Edwin. The nun Ilona has prepared a defence. Please, rise."

# SCENE 41

    "The words were stuck in Ilona's throat. She thinks deeply about the contents of Fleur's letter."

    "{i}I could only choose one or the other, and so I have decided to take a test of faith to prove my worthiness.{/i}"

    il "This murder had two conspirators involved: Salome and Fleur."

    an "Hoh? Go on."

    il "Both Salome and Fleur conspired together to drug the guests at the banquet."

    il "The two of them figured out Edwin's true nature, and so one of them went to steal an item that would allow one to shift into a werewolf."

    an "And so? Who was the one that murdered Uldin?"

    "Ilona thinks carefully about the course of events, and what she really saw."

    "(The corpse of Salome, burned beyond recognition… )"

    "(Her voice was thin, high and frail. Her body seemed smaller, possibly due to the burns…)"

    "(“She could do it, if she wore the wolfskin.”)"

    il "The one who murdered Uldin was Fleur."

    an "Excuse me? I might have believed you if you said it was Salome."

    il "The corpse of Salome has been misidentified."

    an "What? Do you mistrust Kellac's judgement?"

    il "The corpse's face, hair and body was burned to an unrecognizable state. The only identifiers we had were the ring of Salome’s, and her dress - all clothing and effects."

    il "In actuality, it is Fleur's body."

    an "So, we might have mistaken the identity of the corpse. But why Fleur? Did she have a reason for patricide?"

    il "Her letter read: I will strike terror into the one who has abandoned me."

    il "Uldin is not frequently in this town, is he not? He has essentially abandoned his daughter."

    il "Only the guests were targeted to be drugged that night — but not Uldin, nor herself or her mother. She needed him awake to scare him."

    il "Her mother was assisting her in this plot. Fleur never intended to kill, she only wished to scare Uldin, perhaps to convince him to change his behaviour."

    il "She assumed the form of a werewolf, Uldin's worst fear."

    il "She wore her mother's dress, ring and perfume, perhaps to avoid suspicion if found wandering at night."

    an "I refuse to believe this…"

    il "You may believe in the fair folk, but this would explain why you were unable to find her; or even to glimpse any trace of her - she was already dead."

    an "Then how do you explain Fleur's letter? The wooden effigy of her that appeared in her bed?"

    il "Remember… There was an accomplice."

    il "Salome must have entered the room after the howl, and she let out a scream at the sight of both Uldin and Fleur's wounds. She took what was stolen from Edwin, and hid in the room before we entered."

    il "After we left the manse to escort Edwin to the dungeon, Salome was able to move again. She locked the wolfskin away in a chest in her room, and trapped it."

    il "Salome placed the statue in Fleur's bed to make it seem like she was spirited away by the fair folk."

    il "She must have found the letter in Fleur's room, and to make it seem more credible, she placed it in the forest after her escape."

    il "The one that orchestrated the plan was Salome, and she is the survivor. If you don't believe me, I found this."

    "Ilona hands Anari the paper she found in the chest. Upon realizing that it explains the wooden statue of Fleur, she looks thoroughly displeased, nearly crumpling the document."

# SCENE 42

    "Ilona’s proposition is met with mumblings, grumblings, dissatisfied grunts and a few voices of support from the townsfolk. However, it’s all drowned out in the eyes and minds of both Ilona and Anari-"

    "Ilona is shivering, as the warm rays of sun accentuate the bags under her eyes. Tired. Broken. But still standing."

    "It’s impossible to say what Anari might be thinking right now. Her posture unflinching, the totality of her being in complete focus. She asks the crowd to simmer down, her usual aura of conceit fading away."

    "There is now only one question that remains-and a clocktower that's ticking away, endlessly."

    an "Let me ask you: where is Salome?"

    il "That, I can't tell you. I'm certain that my theory is correct, though."

    il "I do not care what happens next, Anari. Whether you believe me or not is irrelevant."

    il "You cannot make me feel guilt for harbouring Edwin as a werewolf. He is not defined by his curse, and I want you to see that."

    il "I have provided evidence and my theory, as you asked. Nothing I do now can change your mind. I accept it, regardless of the outcome."

    an "Nun, I would like to believe you. More than anyone else, believe it or not. As to why I feel that way…"

    an "Well, maybe I can tell you some other time. If we even get a chance that is.{p}In your mind, you may be right..."

    an "But unless you bring me Salome, you can't convince me. The ‘righteousness’ that you preach of is obsolete without tangible proof."

    an "Perhaps I’m misguided, but I’ve had far, far too many repercussions for trusting people in the past. In more ways than you can ever imagine."

    an "If I am wrong, so be it. When my time comes, I’ll gladly accept my penance."

    an "There's one thing that's certain: your arrival into this town brought with it the destruction of this family."

    an "If it weren't for you and Edwin, this tragedy would never have happened."

    il "You're blaming us for being caught in a plot that was using us? For all I know, you were always looking for a reason to kill Edwin.{p}Maybe you planned for this to happen, to usurp power in Belorov."

    an "Hahahahaha! How amusing. I don't desire that in the least."

    an "You should choose your words more wisely, nun. It's unbecoming of a holy woman… but I know that you're really a heretic."

    "With a signal of Anari's hand, two town guards move in on Ilona and grip her arms tightly; drawing them behind her back. She screams loudly."

    il "Aaaaaaaahh! Let me go!"

    "Ilona struggles and tries to shake the men off, but the guards do not relent. One grabs her by the hair. Edwin cannot abide by this any longer. He transforms, the chains snapping off him as he transforms into a massive wolf-man."

    "He rushes at the guards with a growl, knocking them over by slamming against them. He throws them off with both fang and claw, prying Ilona away from them."

    "Anari strings her bow, and takes an arrow from her quiver. She trains it on the werewolf. He's escaping the town square with Ilona still in his arms."

    an "I won't let you escape."

    "When she releases the bowstring, a piercing, otherworldly whistle cries out from her weapon. The arrow grazes Edwin's fur as he transforms from half-man, half-wolf, into an enormous grey wolf."

    "He continues to run on all fours, with only Ilona to guide him. She adjusts herself on his back, grasping tufts of thick fur. Anari scowls, and then goes to climb a tower to gain a higher vantage point."

    il "The guards will have closed the gates. There's a part of the wall that has been rebuilt with jagged stones. That can give you more of a footing."

    "Edwin takes a running leap, and latches his claws into the stone wall. He shifts back into his half-wolf form and starts climbing."

# SCENE 44

    "The looming stone wall in front of them is a substantial hurdle to overcome. The town guards mobilise, firing arrows that torrent Edwin and Ilona. Edwin does his best to throw off their aim."

    "There is one he cannot escape from. Anari's skill with a bow is frightening, her gaze ever calm and steady."

    "Two arrows finally meet its target. They pierce his side, fired in rapid succession. But this isn’t a problem for the werewolf, as he brushes aside the pain. He’s taken greater beatings  than this."

    "However, he’s not invincible; a few more well placed shots and he’s down, along with Ilona."

    il "Stay with me Edwin! Don’t lose sight of our escape. I’ll do my best to heal your wounds with- {w}Ah!"

    "An arrow pierces the hand with which Ilona was trying to use to heal. Her hand twists and contorts, reflexingly convulsing due to the writhing pain."

    ed "Ilona! Ho-hold on, we’re almost there!"

    "Time seems to move too slowly. How much more pain can they accept? Edwin grimaces past the pain of his sustained wounds."

    "There’s no question about it - Ilona knows Anari could never miss her mark, not with a target so large. She’s missing their vitals on purpose."

    "A good look at Anari leaves nothing more than questions.{p}Does she want to let them leave?{p}Or capture and burn them at the stake alive?"

    "Her intentions remain unclear, as one final arrow impales Ilona in the back."

    "With a light scream, Ilona loses her footing. There's only one hand she could use to hold onto the rough stone wall, and her fingers are slipping."

    ed "Ilona! No!"

    "Edwin is quick to react, as he pulls her over while climbing over the wall; carrying her carefully, as though holding an injured bird."

    "The stone wall shows a trail of their blood.{p}They make it out of Belorov, despite their injuries."

# Scene 46

    "Edwin marches on, with Ilona in his arms. It’s too dangerous to be out in the open. They search for a place to rest, as dusk greets them with open arms."

    il "Edwin, set me down. You're more injured than I am."

    ed "Ilona, my darling-"

    il "Darling?"

    "At the awkward exchange, Edwin gingerly sets Ilona down on the ground. He reverts to human form, his ears and face red."

    ed "Yes, I've —  I’ve been waiting to call you that for so long."

    ed "What a fool I was to keep what I felt about you hidden, because you were a nun…"

    ed "The time I spent without you, in that cell. It was excruciating. And that’s when I realised, {w}how much I want you by my side."

    il "My, the exhaustion must be getting you.{p}Now I know you weren't joking about wanting me to meet your family…"

    ed "…"

    il "In all seriousness, thank you. It- it means a lot to me.{p}Could we rest for a while?"

    ed "I don't hear anyone pursuing us. Just for a moment…"

    "They sit under the shade of a tree, basking in its shadow. Their breath is ragged, but in sync with each other's. Ilona rests her head on Edwin’s shoulders."

    ed "I’m sorry."

    il "About what?"

    ed "You’re right about me not saying what it is that I want to say,{p}burying it so deep within the abyss that I can’t even reach it."

    ed "Even if I want to...{p}...And just maybe, if I’d come clean to the people that we came across, {w}to you, {w}about the wolfskin; the incessant nightmares that I’ve been having...."

    ed "I couldn't even trust you to watch me transform..."

    il "It’s okay. We can start over."

    ed "If I’d had the courage to ask for your assistance, we could have found an alternative."

    il "We must be strong and keep our past behind us. What’s done is done."

    il "Besides, I’m here for you now.{p}And you are for me.{p}I’m sure that God will not send another trial to test our resolve."

    ed "I would like to believe that.{p}…"

    ed "Why must the cycle of violence perpetuate? Wherever I go, something always goes wrong."

    ed "I’ve noticed hints of it. Even in  these past few days - mind you, that banquet was all too much for me to begin with. I used to enjoy these things, but now, I..."

    il "Right, I know."

    ed "It felt like everybody there had something to hide, and doubts arose from that…{p}We were all turning against each other."

    ed "Why hide? I know I’m in no position to say this, but I see the absurdity of it all now. It does no good."

    il "I guess it's hard sometimes. Especially when you have no one you can trust,{p}Nobody to confide in."

    il "And you’re all alone, because you always second guess intentions…{p}…{p}There’s nothing worse than feeling utterly alone."

    ed "Is that why Salome did what she did?"

    il "I do not know, but I pity her.{p}I pray that she's not alone.{p}…"

    "Ilona hears Edwin's breathing slow. Ilona is too weary to use healing magic. They can’t remove the arrows that pierce them, or the two of them would surely bleed out and die."

    ed "…"

    il "Edwin?"

    ed "…"

    il "Ed…"

    ed "Yes, love. I'm still here. What is it?"

    il "Is it okay if I close my eyes for a while?{p}I don’t think I’ll be able to hold out for any longer…"

    ed "You may. I'll keep watch, so you can rest."

    il "I wonder — what your family is like…"

    ed "It's a big family… They'll definitely welcome you…"

    il "That sounds… nice…"

    "Edwin watches the brilliance of the sky and clouds, gradually darkening. With Ilona by his side, he relishes in the peace and comfort."

    ed "Ilona, love…"

    il "I'm here. Did you need anything?"

    ed "I-I just…{p}I just wanted to say that I’m indebted."

    il "You're always thanking me…{p}Ed…"

    ed "Yes?"

    il "Do you think you could hold me? I want to lie down…"

    ed "Of course… I'll lie down with you. We should be safe here…"

    il "Thank you…"

    "Ilona lays her head against Edwin's chest, and he gently wraps his arms around her. He heaves a contented sigh, yet the arrows piercing him dig into his weary body."

    "He strokes her hair, speaking softly. He can feel his hands wet with the blood from her wounds."

    ed "If our journey ends here, so be it.{p}I am not lost anymore, I have you."

    ed "With the sun’s blessing over us,{p}I shall now lay to rest."

    ed "And flourish with the bountiful verdue."

    ed "I was never much of a poet,{p}But know that,{p}I love you."

    ed "I-I love…"
