act1_90a357a0		Ilona waits for Edwin to turn back into a human, closing her eyes to rest for a moment. There's only the sound of the forest, until Edwin speaks to break their silence.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	61	"[what]"

act1_cab4f62c	il	You’re right, but I need you to slow down. I can’t keep up with you and that is only going to make us look all the more suspicious.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	80	il "[what]"
act1_161c342c	ed	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	82	ed "[what]"

act1_46e0d11b		As she says this, she places her hands over his. His hands are abnormally cold to touch. Ilona learned this was a sign of his transformation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	95	"[what]"
act1_b8128289		Even so, she must remain with him.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	97	"[what]"

act1_03724bc2	il	You have thanked me more than enough already, Edwin. I appreciate it… but let's not dwell on it any further. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	127	il "[what]"
act1_c37d081b		Their eyes flicker for a moment, and he’s not shivering anymore. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	133	"[what]"
act1_93949162		Eventually, they press on. They sight a lonely settlement on the horizon; stone walls surrounding its perimeter.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	138	"[what]"
act1_174e03cb	ed	Heh…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	143	ed "[what]"
act1_fe98e4f3	ed	I haven't felt like m-myself lately, since the incident back at the priory. Try as I may to blend in, to do good and keep myself in check… I am a beast, through and through.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	147	ed "[what]"
act1_498796b3	ed	What is it that we've done wrong? Is us being together something so heinous? Is my existence such a sin?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	149	ed "[what]"
act1_4e05bc5f	il	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	154	il "[what]"
act1_f0cc2f26	ed	I did not know the extent of the hatred that lay within their souls until that night… to go as far as to burn me alive…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	160	ed "[what]"

act1_2159aab4	il	If you want my answer as a {i}former{/i} nun… You and I have sinned.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	168	il "[what]"

act1_cc29e9ed	il	You're not. You’re-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	174	il "[what]"
act1_b0bd089b		Edwin immediately lets go of her hand, intertwined seconds ago, but now balled into a fist. The rustling of dry leaves brought with it a heavily armed guard and an archer under a cloak.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	182	"[what]"
act1_292a0b43	unk	That's enough loitering around the town wall looking suspicious, don't you think?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	187	unk "[what]"
act1_17fa5516	unk	I've been observing your movements from the battlements for a while now. Be grateful that the town master wishes to have a meeting with you, or else I would have already pierced you with my arrows.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	189	unk "[what]"

act1_fb7348d7	unk	{i}Sister{/i}, all I know is that the master called you. I sighted a nun and a man outside the town walls and informed him of this.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	207	unk "[what]"
act1_59d5ebd0	unk	I can tell your legs are shaking even from here… so make sure to comply obediently and I won't ask any difficult questions about you in return.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	209	unk "[what]"
act1_a6cad620	ed	She simply asked what business the master has with us. You're acting very feisty for someone who didn't even have the decency to introduce herself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	213	ed "[what]"
act1_6928dc2b	unk	Hmph. Fair enough.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	219	unk "[what]"

act1_f253981e	an	I'm not going to probe you or anything.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	225	an "[what]"
act1_a7c02d41	an	You may be outsiders, but you look like decent enough folk. No need to come up with any grand excuses for why you’re here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	227	an "[what]"
act1_e39fd1e3	an	So, let’s get back to it. Will you accept the town master's call?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	229	an "[what]"
act1_e4151a94	il	...I suppose that choice is not truly much of one. I accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	235	il "[what]"
act1_186c0269	an	A wise judgement. You’re clever for a nun, but you should learn to keep your dog in line.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	241	an "[what]"
act1_e1980f05	ed	...Excuse me?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	245	ed "[what]"
act1_4d2e1cfa	an	I don’t appreciate being called ‘feisty’.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	249	an "[what]"
act1_c42899de	ed	I meant no offense when I said that. My apologies.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	255	ed "[what]"
act1_97971ac5	an	So you do have manners; it would do you well to keep them. Let’s get moving, then. I’ll escort you to the manse.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	259	an "[what]"
act1_fad72934		Anari takes the position of rear guard, as the other guard leads the way forward.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	269	"[what]"
act1_c33914e7		Ilona glances back, just once. Anari's bow is by her side and a hand rests on the quiver, ready to fire if the two of them even thought of escaping.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	271	"[what]"
act1_2343e3f7		Ilona cannot help but wonder just how much Anari overheard of their conversation... Her arrival seemed too well-timed.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	273	"[what]"
act1_bd728716		Did they give away too much, even when they thought they were alone?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	275	"[what]"
act1_69a2867d		She glances at Edwin, his face inscrutable. And so, they enter the gates.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	277	"[what]"
act1_b2c677a3	ed	(When was the last time I felt any hope? Anything besides pain? The swelling in my chest is excruciating…)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	286	ed "[what]"
act1_f989775a	ed	(I truly wouldn't have made it this far on my own. Even if I hide what I am well, people can't help but to be suspicious.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	288	ed "[what]"
act1_cc3b6755	ed	(Although - a town full of people not trying to kill me yet is quite an improvement.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	290	ed "[what]"
act1_2e68116d		It’s almost time to head home for normal folk, but the town is bustling. There's a large bonfire in the square, and there's carved turnips at the doors of all the houses-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	292	"[what]"
act1_3a3c3fe1	il	What kind of decorations are these?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	298	il "[what]"

act1_39fb5494	il	You mean All Saints’ Eve? Why are the townsfolk celebrating in joy, then?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	306	il "[what]"
act1_8f79b109	ed	You were raised strictly, Ilona. Father Ivanov never wanted you to know about these pagan festivals.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	313	ed "[what]"
act1_cd161ab9	ed	Oh!-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	320	ed "[what]"
act1_dad19b0c	unk	Young lad, please watch your step. One mistake and this weary old man is done for…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	323	unk "[what]"
act1_6a813be3	ed	I’m so sorry for bumping into you, sir-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	329	ed "[what]"
act1_0c985e71	an	...Kellac, we're the same age.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	332	an "[what]"
act1_6f431cac	ke	Fancy meeting you here, Anari. I didn’t know you like to take strolls. I never knew you had friends either! And who may you be, dear sister?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	335	ke "[what]"
act1_de179210	ed	Uh, I’m not sure we're friends…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	337	ed "[what]"
act1_aaeed289	ke	Pleased to make your acquaintance, anyhow. I’m Kellac, Anari and I go way back.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	339	ke "[what]"
act1_e24e19b8	an	That we do, and I regret it.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	341	an "[what]"
act1_013bf581	ke	You’ve just got to love that personality! Don’t take her too seriously, she's always been like that.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	343	ke "[what]"
act1_5d3c97fb	ed	I see… I'm Edwin. Pleased to make your acquaintance. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	345	ed "[what]"
act1_6af4c780	il	As am I. My name is Ilona. Forgive my ignorance, but are you the master of this town?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	347	il "[what]"
act1_cb0bbce6	ke	Me? Sorry, but no. I'm just the physician and herbalist. Did the master summon you?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	349	ke "[what]"
act1_8d34d888	il	He did, but I don't know what business we have with him...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	351	il "[what]"
act1_320aabaf	ke	Aha. I should have expected as much; Anari has a habit of leaving out the details and jumping straight to the point.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	353	ke "[what]"
act1_db6d3c4a	ke	I should get going, but we're bound to see each other again soon. Keep well, Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	355	ke "[what]"
act1_d0644ba6		Anari only nods curtly, and the group moves along. Further into the town, they find a large house made of timber and stone.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	357	"[what]"
act1_fdb317d1		Edwin wonders, how should they go about this? It’s best they wait and see what happens once they enter.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	359	"[what]"
act1_df1cba86	an	Sir Uldin, Lady Salome. I've brought to you Sister Ilona, and her companion Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	361	an "[what]"
act1_6fd50c4c	ul	So the man was with her after all?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	363	ul "[what]"
act1_872e30dc	an	At first, I thought a holy woman was being accosted by some blackguard. To think that he was her travelling companion...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	366	an "[what]"
act1_1999e055	ed	I understand I may not have the friendliest appearance… but I have sworn to protect Sister Ilona from harm.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	368	ed "[what]"
act1_12e527ef	ul	This is indeed unexpected… Anari's eyes are keen, but perhaps only for hunting her quarry.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	370	ul "[what]"
act1_757ba920	an	True. There's no need to understand the conversations of beasts to hunt them, only their behaviour.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	372	an "[what]"
act1_a0294e55	sa	How amusing... Judging by Anari's report, I would have thought she was describing a saint!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	374	sa "[what]"
act1_0f158e72	il	Thank you for your kind words, but they are far too gracious to be wasted on me... I have not done anything to be deserving of such praise.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	376	il "[what]"
act1_8da3f4d4	sa	I thought you might be able to join us for tonight's feast for All Hallows' Day, and to perhaps lead us in prayer.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	378	sa "[what]"
act1_2f9e9522	ul	It’s not every day that you see a nun, and much less in such unlikely company. So, Would you accept our invitation?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	380	ul "[what]"
act1_238ff7a1		Ilona had to consider this carefully. She and Edwin had drawn too much attention already… So it surprised her when Edwin spoke without any fear.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	382	"[what]"
act1_4119ed7e	ed	We will gladly accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	384	ed "[what]"
act1_ff47b2be	sa	Tonight's banquet will begin shortly, but you should still have time to prepare for it. Anari, let us debrief in the meantime.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	386	sa "[what]"
act1_c91bfff5		It had only been a few days since they were on the run… Ilona could scarcely believe that they were welcomed so readily.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	390	"[what]"
act1_76717860		They sit at a table laden with food: a rich coloured beetroot soup, mulled wine with spices, pickled vegetables, a glistening whole roasted pheasant and even more dishes than one could name.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	392	"[what]"
act1_fe97bc40		Seated at the table were two new faces: Fleur, the daughter of Uldin. On Fleur's left side was Eisleigh, an assistant to the house.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	394	"[what]"
act1_91d3a11a		Uldin plans to rebuild the ruined chapel in Belorov, as Salome is deeply pious. That was why Salome regards the meeting with Ilona as such good fortune.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	396	"[what]"
act1_764c3b9f		As everyone gathers at the table, Uldin urges Ilona to lead them in prayer before the meal.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	398	"[what]"
act1_be7681fc		She speaks a few words of gratitude for the harvest, and for peace and protection. When she lifts her eyes once again, the lively banquet commences.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	400	"[what]"
act1_50f8cc7d	ke	The food smells amazing. Was that the pheasant you caught today, Anari?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	402	ke "[what]"
act1_964c7e5c	an	The very one. Ahh, a successful hunt and high quality spices can put even someone like me in a good mood.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	404	an "[what]"
act1_1f1f5896	ke	You should always be in a good mood, then!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	406	ke "[what]"
act1_71f306ca	an	Heheheh. Fleur, would you like some spiced pheasant?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	408	an "[what]"
act1_853e9921	fl	Oh no, thank you, Aunt Anari. You always make it way too spicy… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	410	fl "[what]"
act1_6cf0d10b	an	That's too bad… I guess you really don't take after Uldin when it comes to food.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	412	an "[what]"
act1_25f9e941	sa	So, what brings you to Belorov, Mister Edwin and Sister Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	414	sa "[what]"
act1_35b3a49e	sa	Our town may not look like much after our chapel was ransacked and destroyed, but it was once breathtaking.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	416	sa "[what]"
act1_581943e6	il	We're… on a pilgrimage. We were just seeking shelter before dark.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	418	il "[what]"
act1_39597b73	il	I heard about the destruction of a chapel some time ago, but I had no idea it was here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	420	il "[what]"
act1_c760f5b4	sa	Yes, it was the barbarians' doing. Even now, we're still rebuilding the town, but the faithful have moved on from here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	422	sa "[what]"
act1_17a8c2ae	sa	I miss having someone to share my connection with God, so I am sorry to impose my sudden invitation on you.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	424	sa "[what]"
act1_cc8bc172	sa	Belorov is home to people of many faiths. Many of us have travelled from afar, like myself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	426	sa "[what]"
act1_170ca600	il	From what I understand, Edwin was also quite the traveller before we met.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	428	il "[what]"

act1_3d28723a	ed	Haha. To tell you everything that happened would tax my wits.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	432	ed "[what]"
act1_a43bdaa6	fl	Have you seen any mythical creatures in your journeys? Ever met the fair folk??	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	434	fl "[what]"
act1_ca698d9a	ed	Let me think. There was this one time I had an encounter with a giant… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	436	ed "[what]"
act1_bb33c4d9		Edwin regales the table with his tale of encountering a giant when he was atop a mountain. Fleur and Salome listen with rapturous attention.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	438	"[what]"
act1_b24cf7d3		Even Kellac takes an interest in these tales, and starts telling of his own travels. He loses track of time, and he decides that it is getting late, and he needs to head in early.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	440	"[what]"
act1_6c871926		Anari leaves to get some rest for her shift as the town guard. Both of them bid everyone at the table a good night.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	442	"[what]"
act1_00cec763		Even though the party thins out a little, Fleur seems as excitable as when she began. Even Eisleigh, who kept to herself as she ate, joins in on the conversation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	444	"[what]"
act1_374321a6	ei	You've really travelled a long way away if you came from across the sea, Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	446	ei "[what]"
act1_5bdd70a9	fl	Now I'm wondering, how did you meet Sister Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	448	fl "[what]"
act1_e9d80bdc	ed	Oh uh… Heh heh. That's a story for another time. I'm pretty tired…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	450	ed "[what]"
act1_040097dc	fl	Oh, could it be…? Is the story of how you met Ilona not suitable for my ears? 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	452	fl "[what]"
act1_2c3eeb68	ei	Ahaha, is that it? You might be onto something, Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	454	ei "[what]"
act1_31ef39a4	il	…{p}(Girls these days are sharp.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	456	il "[what]"
act1_a7941d7f	ed	No no, that's not it at all! It's… not that interesting compared to my other stories.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	458	ed "[what]"
act1_ebbb0a3f	fl	Hmph, I was under the impression you two shared a forbidden romance.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	460	fl "[what]"
act1_a4709631	sa	Fleur, you shouldn't tease guests. And you really shouldn't encourage her, Eisleigh!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	462	sa "[what]"
act1_9d8fd50c	ul	Well, they said they were on a pilgrimage. If their sins are meant to be forgiven in the end, they should be able to sin along the way all they want!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	464	ul "[what]"
act1_4e05bc5f_1	il	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	466	il "[what]"

act1_aef10f2d	fl	I apologize, Mother. And I apologize to you as well, Edwin and Sister Ilona, for insinuating something I should not have. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	472	fl "[what]"
act1_f2bf081a		Ilona and Edwin sheepishly mumble their acceptance of Fleur's apology. There is still too much attention on them…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	474	"[what]"
act1_c290457c		Salome asks everyone their preferences for tea to make preparations, and she excuses herself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	476	"[what]"

act1_dd5136e8		Anari escorts him forcefully out of the mansion, and takes him underground to a dungeon. The only thing Ilona sees before the doors close is Edwin's taciturn and listless expression.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	797	"[what]"

act2_a87ccfba		Ilona tries to find anything else in the room that could have been used. On the nightstand, there's a candle turned over. Droplets of now hard wax marred the wood surface. 	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	26	"[what]"
act2_41798f3f		The burns scorching the wall and room seem too significant to come from just a candle. Near the bed, and on the floor are traces of fur. Some of it is burnt.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	28	"[what]"

act2_d6e770de		The most prominent part of the room is a writing table, items left strewn upon it as though she was in the middle of an important task.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	40	"[what]"

act2_97dc4de9	an	I don't think it has anything to do with the murders. That chest is meant for Fleur when she is married. Salome had it made recently.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	48	an "[what]"
act2_73d91b22	an	It's natural she might have moved it since I was last here. She does worry about Fleur's future, after all…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	50	an "[what]"
act2_7bf291bc		It surprises Ilona that Anari became so candid at this moment. Salome and Anari were closer in age, and it made sense that Anari acted as Salome's confidant.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	52	"[what]"
act2_00c7a59d		They then move to investigate Fleur's room. Ilona couldn't help but be curious about what Anari said earlier. Opening the young girl's room, both of them notice a distinct lump in the bed.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	54	"[what]"
act2_2955ea8e		Ilona looks to Anari. They agree silently to move closer.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	56	"[what]"
act2_438b2537		Anari did not pay any heed to the room's whimsical decor, but Ilona can't help but steal glances at the spectacle of floral and woodland motifs in her belongings as they pass through.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	58	"[what]"
act2_1beb9037		Last night, Ilona never thought too much of Fleur's fascination with strange and mythic tales, especially regarding the fair folk.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	60	"[what]"
act2_b7e7a782		She thought it to be just a passing interest. Her room speaks otherwise; the girl seems utterly devoted to tales of fantasy.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	62	"[what]"
act2_35de39d4		When they reach the bed, Ilona isn't sure what to expect. Anari remains behind her, and nods for Ilona to pull back the covers. Ilona could see something that looked like it's carved from wood…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	64	"[what]"
act2_bbd614a6		It resembles a wood statue, or an effigy.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	66	"[what]"
act2_65a9b3d6		The face looks eerily like Fleur, her expression mysterious; neither happy or sad. The rest of the body looks as though it remains trapped inside a still-living tree.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	68	"[what]"
act2_844c4a58	an	Impossible…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	70	an "[what]"
act2_2e1fdea2		Anari does not say anything else, but moves back from the effigy. Her hand is balled into a fist, and is shaking, either from rage or fear.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	72	"[what]"
act2_b5e0db36	an	I-I've seen quite enough. I'm leaving this ghastly room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	74	an "[what]"
act2_1b16204f		She turns immediately on her heel. The sudden reaction surprises Ilona, and she is unsure whether to follow or not.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	76	"[what]"
act2_d9182ec8		Finding nothing else of note in the room, Ilona rejoins Anari. She finds Anari with her back pressed to the wall, steadily taking deep breaths.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	78	"[what]"
act2_62509399		For a woman who seemed to fear nothing, Ilona couldn't fathom why Anari looked so scared at that moment.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	80	"[what]"
act2_fa8f7fd5	il	Anari… you don’t look too well. I think we should pause our investigation for the moment.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	84	il "[what]"

act2_875860f7	il	I only wish to see that you’re in good health to proceed, and I thought we could take a quick break-	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	96	il "[what]"
act2_720019eb	an	With some tea, I get it. Very well, I must tell you that I despise the tea from this country, so it better be good enough-	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	98	an "[what]"
act2_ed77b929	il	Then is there any kind of tea you like?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	100	il "[what]"
act2_81f8daf0	an	…Fine black tea, with bitter orange. I think Uldin still had some in his pantry.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	102	an "[what]"
act2_0c8d636a		Both of them fall silent. There is nobody in the house who can say what to do with Uldin's possessions… Anari isn't even sure if he left a will.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	104	"[what]"
act2_a9f68539		Uldin isn't around anymore to enjoy what he had in life, that is certain.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	106	"[what]"
act2_d2ea9a52		Anari goes into the pantry and finds some tea bricks sealed in a container. She was sure that last night, Salome and Fleur did talk about this kind of tea.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	108	"[what]"
act2_69b40299		Ilona, feeling some remorse as though the two of them were bandits, prepares the deceased man's tea according to Anari's instruction. Trying her best to be hospitable, Ilona also serves it with milk and sugar, as Fleur did.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	110	"[what]"
act2_2b8ffe1c	il	Here you go. Please, have some.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	112	il "[what]"
act2_08758ff0		Ilona serves tea to Anari. As expected, Anari does not take any of the milk or sugar. In contrast, Ilona puts a generous amount of both in hers. The taste was far too bitter for her to enjoy so early in the morning.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	114	"[what]"
act2_6e353178		Anari leans back in her chair, closing her eyes and taking in the aroma. She takes a sip before putting her tea cup down elegantly, without even the slightest clatter.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	116	"[what]"
act2_5157e0c6		Ilona follows suit, but she is not nearly as graceful. Anari rubs her temples with the tips of her fingers, before speaking again.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	118	"[what]"
act2_a9185d84	an	Not bad. Tell me, are all nuns this annoying?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	120	an "[what]"
act2_ff3eb2a5	il	Pardon me?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	122	il "[what]"
act2_8ddf271f	an	Whatever you're trying to do is futile. Re-examining the corpses or the rooms won't change anything — Edwin was the one who killed them.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	124	an "[what]"
act2_3188e408	il	What makes you so sure of that?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	126	il "[what]"
act2_88105179	an	I heard the details from Kellac and Eisleigh.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	128	an "[what]"
act2_a87a02e2		Anari details how the events played out: Salome screamed. It was heard by Kellac and Ilona, sleeping on the floor below. Edwin was not in his room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	130	"[what]"
act2_37aca9f5		Therefore, Edwin was already inside the master's chambers at the time of the murder.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	132	"[what]"
act2_b36ddfae		It took some time to make it to the servants quarters and the other guest lodgings, which are on the opposite end of the manse.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	134	"[what]"
act2_ce21cafd	an	Everyone's locations were accounted for:	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	136	an "[what]"
act2_197896ba	an	I was on patrol as the head of the town guard.{p}Kellac was the first one to react to the scream, followed by you.{p}Eisleigh was in her room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	138	an "[what]"
act2_c0610e4e	an	Each of us were able to confirm each others' locations at the time of the murder. The only one who couldn't be found was Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	140	an "[what]"
act2_b1182eb0	il	How do you suppose that everyone is saying the absolute truth?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	142	il "[what]"
act2_f445e1f9		Kellac could have acted as if he had witnessed the murder. We have no account of what he was doing before that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	144	"[what]"
act2_97c92519		There was also nobody around to confirm that Eisleigh was not at the crime scene, and I found her alone.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	146	"[what]"
act2_f9782b77		And finally, where was Fleur? You do understand where I’m coming from, yes?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	148	"[what]"
act2_5c405b25	an	Yes, I do. You’re smarter than you look, nun.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	150	an "[what]"
act2_0ed506eb	an	Indeed, Fleur was missing at the time of the murder. Nobody had seen her enter, or exit the manse. I'll give you that much, but I highly doubt she was the murderer. She's far too frail.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	152	an "[what]"
act2_361deded	il	When Eisleigh and I returned, the door was broken in during the time we were away.{p}How do you explain that?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	154	il "[what]"

act2_5cad183e	an	However, I will not let my prejudice against the two of you get the better of me. Considering that, let’s start off with the motivation for murder.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	164	an "[what]"
act2_86738172	an	Kellac was an associate of Uldin and I during the war. He’s selfless, to the point of stupidity. I guess serving as a medic did that to him.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	166	an "[what]"
act2_710dd6f9	an	It’s hard to admit this, but I consider Kellac to be close to me. He is a kind-hearted man.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	168	an "[what]"
act2_bc4e0511	an	But that’s not why he’s off the hook. He… has no reason for murder.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	170	an "[what]"
act2_7a0a93e8	il	Please explain.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	172	il "[what]"
act2_682f810a	an	He’s weak, so I doubt he could overpower both Uldin and Salome. Anything else he needs, whether coin or rare books on magic, he could simply ask Uldin.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	174	an "[what]"
act2_fc197eac	an	And Uldin wouldn't hesitate, because they share quite the history.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	176	an "[what]"
act2_48031ca3	an	Although, I do know one thing. Kellac is hiding something. His fiance died in a tragic and bizarre accident, and it haunts him to this day. It even keeps him up at night.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	178	an "[what]"
act2_d8432e9c	an	Whether it’s related to this case, I do not know.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	180	an "[what]"

act2_0e8cad35		Silence looms over, waiting to be broken. Anari glares, her hand instinctively touches one of her arrows. She grimaces, and folds her arms across her body.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	218	"[what]"
act2_4601b386	il	I’m sorry. I didn’t - I didn't mean to lash out at you like that. It’s just... I want to find the culprit behind this mess.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	220	il "[what]"

act2_dd441fb4		Kellac is waiting at the square, and he exchanges some words with Anari. Their voices are indistinct and quiet.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	264	"[what]"

act2_e9129607		It is taking everything for her to stay conscious. Anari glances at Ilona, before smiling to herself and walking away. Ilona sees a figure move in front of her, clad in black robes…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	268	"[what]"

act2_2f5d6765		When Ilona opens her eyes again, she's in an unfamiliar bed and room. The air is heavy with an earthy smell, suffocatingly so.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	284	"[what]"
act2_4f8b3bf1		She feels far too conscious of her body. Her mouth feels dry, and her heart still feels like it's beating too fast.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	286	"[what]"

act2_2c7b7ea2		Ilona grimaces. Too much time was lost. She moves her arms slowly, her body heavy. Sensation comes back into the tips of her fingers, and the unpleasant tingling stops. The smell of herbal medicine starts to become more bearable to her senses.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	296	"[what]"
act2_cc21f019	ke	It wasn't an ordinary fainting spell. You should have regained consciousness more quickly if it was simply fatigue and stress.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	298	ke "[what]"
act2_9779ebdf	ke	I've taken precautions, and treated you for poisoning.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	300	ke "[what]"

act2_9a5b13ba	ke	…I suppose you can't really rule out that possibility.{p}Did you eat or drink anything with her?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	304	ke "[what]"
act2_9082dcdd	il	Only tea, but I was the one who suggested and prepared it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	306	il "[what]"
act2_63b34e36	il	I didn't see her slip anything in my drink. In fact, I'm quite certain she thought I was trying to poison her…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	308	il "[what]"
act2_4ace551a	ke	I know how she is, but I don't really think she's the type.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	310	ke "[what]"
act2_2c1e143d	ke	She may seem cruel, but I don't think she would go that far to sabotage your efforts and put a stop to you.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	312	ke "[what]"
act2_d552af7b	il	I need to ask, and I don’t have much time. You and Anari know each other well.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	314	il "[what]"
act2_380023cc	il	Do you have any idea why she might be so afraid about the wooden statue resembling Fleur?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	316	il "[what]"
act2_d7318d15	ke	Truth be told, I don't really know much about her history, only rumours. She must think that the statue has to do something with the fae — she mistrusts them due to her past.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	318	ke "[what]"
act2_30185a28	ke	Fleur admires the fair folk. The wooden statue is too elaborate to be one of Fleur's pranks, especially at a time when her parents are dead…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	320	ke "[what]"
act2_fab61602	il	So her extreme reaction to seeing the statue of Fleur has to do with her trauma, and distaste for Fleur's fae-related tricks?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	322	il "[what]"
act2_945c576d	ke	Something like that. Anari hates being pitied, and she doesn't show pity for anyone else either.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	324	ke "[what]"
act2_c1c2f116	ke	She would be fearful about the idea that Fleur has been spirited away by the fair folk. {w}It's not something that she could accept, which is probably why she is leading the search.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	326	ke "[what]"
act2_9a7cdb05		Ilona shifts her body off the bed, able to move freely again. Kellac invites her to take a seat at the table, and Ilona does so. He pours her some clear water.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	328	"[what]"
act2_a82c456b	ke	About the tea you had with Anari — did you happen to find anything odd with it? {w}I'm asking because before the banquet, I gave Uldin his medicine, a powerful soporific.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	330	ke "[what]"
act2_40695a63	ke	There were three less doses in the pantry when I checked.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	332	ke "[what]"
act2_02696b2e	il	Then, you think someone last night—	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	334	il "[what]"
act2_cab4523c		There's a light knock on the door. Kellac tells them to enter, it's Eisleigh.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	336	"[what]"
act2_f370f571	ei	Oh, Ilona — I heard you fainted in the town square. I was worried.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	338	ei "[what]"
act2_eea45996	ke	I invited Eisleigh over for lunch. Ilona, you probably haven't eaten at all yet, have you? You should try to eat, even if it's just a little.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	340	ke "[what]"
act2_e72bef98_3	il	…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	342	il "[what]"
act2_3724b9da	ke	…I guess it's hard to trust anyone after what you've been through.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	344	ke "[what]"
act2_d9c2ae1f	il	No, it's fine… I'll eat with you. You're right, I probably can't do much if I don't take care of myself.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	346	il "[what]"
act2_787c1582		Kellac serves Eisleigh and Ilona a rustic stew, with dark bread and clear water on the side. During the time eating together, Eisleigh asks about the investigation, and Ilona repeats Anari's reasoning surrounding Eisleigh and Kellac.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	348	"[what]"
act2_16e577b6		Ilona would have thought that Anari's defense was unbreakable, but there was actually one new thing they learnt about last night…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	350	"[what]"
act2_e7df4165	il	About what I was saying earlier, did you think someone tried to drug us during the banquet?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	352	il "[what]"
act2_29615adf	ke	That was what I feared. Anari and I left before that, so I don't really have a clear picture of what exactly happened.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	354	ke "[what]"
act2_fd26a42f	il	Last night, I drank tea without sugar or milk, following Fleur and Uldin's example. This morning, I had milk and sugar with it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	356	il "[what]"
act2_4919e76c	ei	I remember Fleur being insistent on putting sugar in my tea, which I thought was weird.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	358	ei "[what]"
act2_6b9f322d	ke	How much sugar did you put in your tea this morning, Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	360	ke "[what]"
act2_1c4e73e0	il	Four spoonfuls…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	362	il "[what]"
act2_b3a05db6	ei	Uhh, that sure is a lot…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	364	ei "[what]"
act2_5c4b0c72	ke	Goodness, no wonder you were out for so long! I'm surprised Anari was able to hold back her rage when she saw you do that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	366	ke "[what]"
act2_59edcc47	ei	I think we can confirm this theory to be true then: someone was trying to put us into a deep sleep, and perhaps they were trying to target Edwin specifically.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	368	ei "[what]"
act2_ee2d4c2a	il	Then this would implicate Salome, or Fleur most strongly. They were the ones who prepared the tea last night.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	370	il "[what]"
act2_4f3e4d06	ei	I- I don't really want to believe it, but I can't deny it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	372	ei "[what]"
act2_70546af0	ke	Actually, this could implicate Uldin too.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	374	ke "[what]"
act2_e51181ee	ke	The truth is… the medicine he uses is made to look inconspicuous because it can be used specifically to drug someone.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	376	ke "[what]"
act2_f5d45f50	ke	I never inquired too closely about it, but he comes from a rather unscrupulous family; so it wouldn't surprise me if he was aware of this plot.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	378	ke "[what]"
act2_e5b5fd68		Kellac seems to know the most about Uldin's family and his circumstances, so Ilona asked for more information.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	380	"[what]"
act2_fc2e31cf		Uldin suffered from insomnia, and slept in separate arrangements so as to not disturb his wife. Last night was also one of the rare occasions when Uldin was back in town, as he travelled frequently for his research; studying magic.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	382	"[what]"
act2_5534675e		On the topic of magic, Eisleigh recalls something that she needed to discuss.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	384	"[what]"
act2_c38edafb	ei	Do you know more about how Edwin is able to transform into a werewolf?{p}Have you ever seen him do it?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	386	ei "[what]"
act2_ada2ff3e	il	No, I haven't. When he transforms, even when I ask him to, he tells me to look away or to close my eyes.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	388	il "[what]"
act2_9b1b4cae	ke	Wait, why do you ask him to transform? What do you do when he's a werewolf?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	390	ke "[what]"
act2_85be9de6	il	It's… a secret.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	392	il "[what]"
act2_d5ce7b80	ei	Secret… Wait, that's precisely it!	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	394	ei "[what]"
act2_e9b634cd		Everyone else looks at Eisleigh in alarm.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	396	"[what]"
act2_e6623b8c	ei	I heard of shapechangers before in my studies of cursed objects. They would use either an ointment, or the pelt of an animal, to assume the form of a beast.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	398	ei "[what]"
act2_f35a5c3d	ei	If the curse was tied to his body, he wouldn't fear you witnessing his transformation.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	400	ei "[what]"
act2_c5aa73b5	ei	But what if it was an item? If he feared betrayal, he wouldn't even show it to an ally.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	402	ei "[what]"
act2_0ad82997	ei	Additionally, there's always a risk involved in keeping that item safe — so it is better that only the bearer knows of it, because —	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	404	ei "[what]"
act2_8febdca0	ei	— it could get lost, destroyed, or… stolen.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	406	ei "[what]"
act2_50f8cd12	ei	Yes. There is a high chance that this cursed pelt still exists. If it was destroyed, he would have died along with it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	408	ei "[what]"
act2_039bb063	ei	Also, it gives us a reason as to why Edwin was drugged last night: Uldin and Salome are sharp, and they might have caught onto Edwin being a werewolf early on.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	410	ei "[what]"
act2_737f6067	il	If we restore this item to Edwin, would it restore the transformed arms back to human form?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	412	il "[what]"
act2_3c30db55	ei	It's possible, especially if the item controls the transformation. A cursed item like that can generally only be bound to one person.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	414	ei "[what]"
act2_4581eac4	ei	Someone else could have also used it, but… Uldin would understand the consequences of a cursed item. I highly doubt it would be him.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	416	ei "[what]"
act2_61707934	ke	Even so, finding this item might help us in finding the true culprit, or to make sense of this tragedy…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	418	ke "[what]"
act2_db182983	ke	Though, if we don't find the culprit, you might not be able to convince everyone that Edwin is innocent.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	420	ke "[what]"
act2_aeea6833	il	Do you mean Anari? What would it take to convince her of Edwin's innocence?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	422	il "[what]"
act2_59458eb5	ke	In short of having the culprit confess their crime, or finding Fleur in hope for an answer… I don't know.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	424	ke "[what]"
act2_8b692128		The three of them start their search for the cursed pelt. Based on Anari's report, Kellac confirms with Ilona that nobody was able to enter or exit the town after Ilona and Edwin entered.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	428	"[what]"
act2_13b633c9		Eisleigh was eager to help out in any way possible, now that there was a chance of witnessing or finding a cursed magical object.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	430	"[what]"
act2_e2572cd6	ei	Kellac knows this, but I am not meant to have a copy of the master key.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	432	ei "[what]"
act2_4306004e	ei	The reason why I was an assistant to this household, was because I tried to steal one of Uldin's rare books…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	434	ei "[what]"
act2_181e78b6	ei	However, I've put the past well behind me. Uldin made me his friend instead of punishing me, and I'm thankful for that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	436	ei "[what]"
act2_3185af9e		Ilona can’t help but find this suspicious. They start their search around Uldin's chambers. Once again, they see the mutilated corpse of Uldin, and the corpse of Salome, burned beyond recognition…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	438	"[what]"
act2_9538cd64		Despite thoroughly searching the bodies, the trio was unable to find the wolfskin or anything else of importance.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	440	"[what]"
act2_8292a09c		They move onto Salome's room. Nothing appears to have been touched since the last time Ilona was here with Anari. Like Anari, Eisleigh comments that the chest was moved and then moves to inspect it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	442	"[what]"
act2_2c3a995d	ei	This chest… Last time I saw it, it wasn’t locked. Salome was still re-arranging it to look nice when I last saw her.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	444	ei "[what]"
act2_935c4add	ei	Let me try opening it…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	446	ei "[what]"
act2_e22cd35e		Eisleigh pulls out a set of various different keys and picks, agitating each in the keyhole, to no avail.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	448	"[what]"
act2_60eb06db	il	I thought you said you had put the past behind you.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	452	il "[what]"

act2_a28622fd		Kellac and Eisleigh make their descent down the stairs. All that remains near the chest is the blood that poured out from Eisleigh's hand, the set of lockpick and Ilona.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	482	"[what]"
act2_55c53177		The hairs on Ilona’s arms raise, and she can feel her heart beat faster. She puts her hand on her chest, as though uttering a short prayer.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	484	"[what]"

act3_56e4d344		He continues to run on all fours, with only Ilona to guide him. She adjusts herself on his back, grasping tufts of thick fur. Anari scowls, and then goes to climb a tower to gain a higher vantage point.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	295	"[what]"
