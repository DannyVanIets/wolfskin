act1_90a357a0		Ilona waits for Edwin to turn back into a human, closing her eyes to rest for a moment. There's only the sound of the forest, until Edwin speaks to break their silence.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	83	"[what]"

act1_cab4f62c	il	You’re right, but I need you to slow down. I can’t keep up with you and that is only going to make us look all the more suspicious.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	103	il "[what]"
act1_161c342c	ed	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	105	ed "[what]"

act1_46e0d11b		As she says this, she places her hands over his. His hands are abnormally cold to touch. Ilona learned this was a sign of his transformation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	120	"[what]"
act1_b8128289		Even so, she must remain with him.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	122	"[what]"

act1_03724bc2	il	You have thanked me more than enough already, Edwin. I appreciate it… but let's not dwell on it any further. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	152	il "[what]"
act1_c37d081b		Their eyes flicker for a moment, and he’s not shivering anymore. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	158	"[what]"
act1_93949162		Eventually, they press on. They sight a lonely settlement on the horizon; stone walls surrounding its perimeter.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	165	"[what]"
act1_174e03cb	ed	Heh…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	170	ed "[what]"
act1_fe98e4f3	ed	I haven't felt like m-myself lately, since the incident back at the priory. Try as I may to blend in, to do good and keep myself in check… I am a beast, through and through.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	174	ed "[what]"
act1_498796b3	ed	What is it that we've done wrong? Is us being together something so heinous? Is my existence such a sin?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	176	ed "[what]"
act1_4e05bc5f	il	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	181	il "[what]"
act1_f0cc2f26	ed	I did not know the extent of the hatred that lay within their souls until that night… to go as far as to burn me alive…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	187	ed "[what]"
act1_bdf2c12b	ed	Is there something wrong with me, Ilona? I'm always on edge, fearing for our lives… I never meant to put you through this.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	189	ed "[what]"
act1_2159aab4	il	If you want my answer as a former nun… You and I have sinned.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	195	il "[what]"

act1_cc29e9ed	il	You're not. You’re-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	201	il "[what]"
act1_b0bd089b		Edwin immediately lets go of her hand, intertwined seconds ago, but now balled into a fist. The rustling of dry leaves brought with it a heavily armed guard and an archer under a cloak.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	211	"[what]"
act1_292a0b43	unk	That's enough loitering around the town wall looking suspicious, don't you think?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	213	unk "[what]"
act1_17fa5516	unk	I've been observing your movements from the battlements for a while now. Be grateful that the town master wishes to have a meeting with you, or else I would have already pierced you with my arrows.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	218	unk "[what]"

act1_fb7348d7	unk	Sister, all I know is that the master called you. I sighted a nun and a man outside the town walls and informed him of this.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	234	unk "[what]"
act1_59d5ebd0	unk	I can tell your legs are shaking even from here… so make sure to comply obediently and I won't ask any difficult questions about you in return.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	236	unk "[what]"
act1_a6cad620	ed	She simply asked what business the master has with us. You're acting very feisty for someone who didn't even have the decency to introduce herself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	240	ed "[what]"
act1_6928dc2b	unk	Hmph. Fair enough.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	246	unk "[what]"

act1_f253981e	an	I'm not going to probe you or anything.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	256	an "[what]"
act1_a7c02d41	an	You may be outsiders, but you look like decent enough folk. No need to come up with any grand excuses for why you’re here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	258	an "[what]"
act1_e39fd1e3	an	So, let’s get back to it. Will you accept the town master's call?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	260	an "[what]"
act1_e4151a94	il	...I suppose that choice is not truly much of one. I accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	266	il "[what]"
act1_186c0269	an	A wise judgement. You’re clever for a nun, but you should learn to keep your dog in line.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	272	an "[what]"
act1_e1980f05	ed	...Excuse me?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	276	ed "[what]"
act1_4d2e1cfa	an	I don’t appreciate being called ‘feisty’.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	280	an "[what]"
act1_c42899de	ed	I meant no offense when I said that. My apologies.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	286	ed "[what]"
act1_97971ac5	an	So you do have manners; it would do you well to keep them. Let’s get moving, then. I’ll escort you to the manse.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	290	an "[what]"
act1_fad72934		Anari takes the position of rear guard, as the other guard leads the way forward.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	297	"[what]"
act1_c33914e7		Ilona glances back, just once. Anari's bow is by her side and a hand rests on the quiver, ready to fire if the two of them even thought of escaping.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	299	"[what]"
act1_2343e3f7		Ilona cannot help but wonder just how much Anari overheard of their conversation... Her arrival seemed too well-timed.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	301	"[what]"
act1_bd728716		Did they give away too much, even when they thought they were alone?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	303	"[what]"
act1_69a2867d		She glances at Edwin, his face inscrutable. And so, they enter the gates.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	307	"[what]"
act1_b2c677a3	ed	(When was the last time I felt any hope? Anything besides pain? The swelling in my chest is excruciating…)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	319	ed "[what]"
act1_f989775a	ed	(I truly wouldn't have made it this far on my own. Even if I hide what I am well, people can't help but to be suspicious.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	321	ed "[what]"
act1_cc3b6755	ed	(Although - a town full of people not trying to kill me yet is quite an improvement.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	323	ed "[what]"
act1_2e68116d		It’s almost time to head home for normal folk, but the town is bustling. There's a large bonfire in the square, and there's carved turnips at the doors of all the houses-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	325	"[what]"
act1_3a3c3fe1	il	What kind of decorations are these?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	331	il "[what]"

act1_8f79b109	ed	You were raised strictly, Ilona. Father Ivanov never wanted you to know about these pagan festivals.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	346	ed "[what]"
act1_cd161ab9	ed	Oh!-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	353	ed "[what]"

act1_0c985e71	an	...Kellac, we're the same age.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	372	an "[what]"
act1_6f431cac	ke	Fancy meeting you here, Anari. I didn’t know you like to take strolls. I never knew you had friends either! And who may you be, dear sister?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	378	ke "[what]"
act1_de179210	ed	Uh, I’m not sure we're friends…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	383	ed "[what]"
act1_aaeed289	ke	Pleased to make your acquaintance, anyhow. I’m Kellac, Anari and I go way back.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	385	ke "[what]"
act1_e24e19b8	an	That we do, and I regret it.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	387	an "[what]"
act1_013bf581	ke	You’ve just got to love that personality! Don’t take her too seriously, she's always been like that.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	389	ke "[what]"
act1_5d3c97fb	ed	I see… I'm Edwin. Pleased to make your acquaintance. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	391	ed "[what]"
act1_6af4c780	il	As am I. My name is Ilona. Forgive my ignorance, but are you the master of this town?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	393	il "[what]"
act1_cb0bbce6	ke	Me? Sorry, but no. I'm just the physician and herbalist. Did the master summon you?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	395	ke "[what]"
act1_8d34d888	il	He did, but I don't know what business we have with him...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	397	il "[what]"
act1_320aabaf	ke	Aha. I should have expected as much; Anari has a habit of leaving out the details and jumping straight to the point.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	399	ke "[what]"
act1_db6d3c4a	ke	I should get going, but we're bound to see each other again soon. Keep well, Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	401	ke "[what]"
act1_d0644ba6		Anari only nods curtly, and the group moves along. Further into the town, they find a large house made of timber and stone.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	405	"[what]"
act1_fdb317d1		Edwin wonders, how should they go about this? It’s best they wait and see what happens once they enter.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	407	"[what]"
act1_df1cba86	an	Sir Uldin, Lady Salome. I've brought to you Sister Ilona, and her companion Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	425	an "[what]"
act1_6fd50c4c	ul	So the man was with her after all?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	429	ul "[what]"
act1_872e30dc	an	At first, I thought a holy woman was being accosted by some blackguard. To think that he was her travelling companion...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	435	an "[what]"
act1_1999e055	ed	I understand I may not have the friendliest appearance… but I have sworn to protect Sister Ilona from harm.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	437	ed "[what]"
act1_12e527ef	ul	This is indeed unexpected… Anari's eyes are keen, but perhaps only for hunting her quarry.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	439	ul "[what]"
act1_757ba920	an	True. There's no need to understand the conversations of beasts to hunt them, only their behaviour.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	441	an "[what]"
act1_a0294e55	sa	How amusing... Judging by Anari's report, I would have thought she was describing a saint!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	443	sa "[what]"
act1_0f158e72	il	Thank you for your kind words, but they are far too gracious to be wasted on me... I have not done anything to be deserving of such praise.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	445	il "[what]"
act1_8da3f4d4	sa	I thought you might be able to join us for tonight's feast for All Hallows' Day, and to perhaps lead us in prayer.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	447	sa "[what]"
act1_2f9e9522	ul	It’s not every day that you see a nun, and much less in such unlikely company. So, Would you accept our invitation?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	449	ul "[what]"
act1_238ff7a1		Ilona had to consider this carefully. She and Edwin had drawn too much attention already… So it surprised her when Edwin spoke without any fear.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	451	"[what]"
act1_4119ed7e	ed	We will gladly accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	453	ed "[what]"
act1_ff47b2be	sa	Tonight's banquet will begin shortly, but you should still have time to prepare for it. Anari, let us debrief in the meantime.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	455	sa "[what]"
act1_c91bfff5		It had only been a few days since they were on the run… Ilona could scarcely believe that they were welcomed so readily.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	464	"[what]"
act1_76717860		They sit at a table laden with food: a rich coloured beetroot soup, mulled wine with spices, pickled vegetables, a glistening whole roasted pheasant and even more dishes than one could name.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	466	"[what]"
act1_fe97bc40		Seated at the table were two new faces: Fleur, the daughter of Uldin. On Fleur's left side was Eisleigh, an assistant to the house.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	468	"[what]"
act1_91d3a11a		Uldin plans to rebuild the ruined chapel in Belorov, as Salome is deeply pious. That was why Salome regards the meeting with Ilona as such good fortune.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	470	"[what]"
act1_764c3b9f		As everyone gathers at the table, Uldin urges Ilona to lead them in prayer before the meal.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	472	"[what]"
act1_be7681fc		She speaks a few words of gratitude for the harvest, and for peace and protection. When she lifts her eyes once again, the lively banquet commences.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	474	"[what]"
act1_50f8cc7d	ke	The food smells amazing. Was that the pheasant you caught today, Anari?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	476	ke "[what]"
act1_964c7e5c	an	The very one. Ahh, a successful hunt and high quality spices can put even someone like me in a good mood.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	478	an "[what]"
act1_1f1f5896	ke	You should always be in a good mood, then!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	480	ke "[what]"
act1_71f306ca	an	Heheheh. Fleur, would you like some spiced pheasant?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	482	an "[what]"
act1_853e9921	fl	Oh no, thank you, Aunt Anari. You always make it way too spicy… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	484	fl "[what]"
act1_6cf0d10b	an	That's too bad… I guess you really don't take after Uldin when it comes to food.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	486	an "[what]"
act1_25f9e941	sa	So, what brings you to Belorov, Mister Edwin and Sister Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	488	sa "[what]"
act1_35b3a49e	sa	Our town may not look like much after our chapel was ransacked and destroyed, but it was once breathtaking.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	490	sa "[what]"
act1_581943e6	il	We're… on a pilgrimage. We were just seeking shelter before dark.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	492	il "[what]"
act1_39597b73	il	I heard about the destruction of a chapel some time ago, but I had no idea it was here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	494	il "[what]"
act1_c760f5b4	sa	Yes, it was the barbarians' doing. Even now, we're still rebuilding the town, but the faithful have moved on from here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	496	sa "[what]"
act1_17a8c2ae	sa	I miss having someone to share my connection with God, so I am sorry to impose my sudden invitation on you.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	498	sa "[what]"
act1_cc8bc172	sa	Belorov is home to people of many faiths. Many of us have travelled from afar, like myself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	500	sa "[what]"
act1_170ca600	il	From what I understand, Edwin was also quite the traveller before we met.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	502	il "[what]"

act1_3d28723a	ed	Haha. To tell you everything that happened would tax my wits.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	506	ed "[what]"
act1_c92c3073	fl	Have you seen any mythical creatures in your journeys? Ever met the fair folk?? I've always dreamed of finding one!!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	508	fl "[what]"
act1_ca698d9a	ed	Let me think. There was this one time I had an encounter with a giant… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	510	ed "[what]"
act1_bb33c4d9		Edwin regales the table with his tale of encountering a giant when he was atop a mountain. Fleur and Salome listen with rapturous attention.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	512	"[what]"
act1_b24cf7d3		Even Kellac takes an interest in these tales, and starts telling of his own travels. He loses track of time, and he decides that it is getting late, and he needs to head in early.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	514	"[what]"
act1_6c871926		Anari leaves to get some rest for her shift as the town guard. Both of them bid everyone at the table a good night.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	516	"[what]"
act1_00cec763		Even though the party thins out a little, Fleur seems as excitable as when she began. Even Eisleigh, who kept to herself as she ate, joins in on the conversation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	518	"[what]"
act1_25dd3d4a	ei	You've really travelled a long way if you came from across the sea, Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	520	ei "[what]"

act1_e9d80bdc	ed	Oh uh… Heh heh. That's a story for another time. I'm pretty tired…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	524	ed "[what]"
act1_040097dc	fl	Oh, could it be…? Is the story of how you met Ilona not suitable for my ears? 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	526	fl "[what]"
act1_2c3eeb68	ei	Ahaha, is that it? You might be onto something, Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	528	ei "[what]"

act1_a7941d7f	ed	No no, that's not it at all! It's… not that interesting compared to my other stories.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	533	ed "[what]"
act1_c8637b7a	fl	Hmph, I was under the impression you two shared a forbidden romance. Perhaps the strange forces that wander tonight will tip the scales at last!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	535	fl "[what]"
act1_a4709631	sa	Fleur, you shouldn't tease guests. And you really shouldn't encourage her, Eisleigh!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	537	sa "[what]"
act1_726f2495	fl	Mother, it's All Hallow's Eve! Tricks and pranks are part of the fun. I'm merely teaching Sister Ilona about this part of the festival — She shouldn't be so serious and uptight all the time!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	539	fl "[what]"
act1_9d8fd50c	ul	Well, they said they were on a pilgrimage. If their sins are meant to be forgiven in the end, they should be able to sin along the way all they want!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	541	ul "[what]"
act1_4e05bc5f_1	il	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	543	il "[what]"

act1_dac2d694	sa	Not you too, dear… You must have had too much to drink.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	547	sa "[what]"

act1_8214f3a8		Ilona crouches down beside Edwin. His distant gaze lacks warmth and familiarity.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	883	"[what]"

act1_c1efbc98		Hearing him talk reassures her slightly. Ilona gingerly takes his wolf-like hands into hers. Even though his gaze is cold and stony, the hands still hold warmth.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	894	"[what]"

act1_4aebe2fc		Ilona isn't sure if Edwin obliged so easily because he feared for her safety, or if he truly has given up; like what Anari said earlier. He wordlessly lets Anari bind him with chains.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	914	"[what]"
act1_dd5136e8		Anari escorts him forcefully out of the mansion, and takes him underground to a dungeon. The only thing Ilona sees before the doors close is Edwin's taciturn and listless expression.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	916	"[what]"
act1_48bbc809		With Edwin locked away, the remaining members of the party gather in the town square: Ilona, Eisleigh, Kellac and Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	928	"[what]"

act2_d4d1eea3		Ilona takes a look once more at the corpses of Salome and Uldin.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	27	"[what]"
act2_2537e4a8		Kellac examined the bodies when Edwin was being escorted to the dungeon.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	29	"[what]"
act2_7121ef7f		According to Anari, his role as a physician was extensive and he treated many people during the war.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	31	"[what]"
act2_aa852085		This also meant that he's seen many corpses, making him considerably accurate in determining the time of death.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	33	"[what]"
act2_0076842d		The methods and reasons for their death are clear. To do a further examination, Kellac would have to perform an autopsy.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	35	"[what]"
act2_e5bcebe9		From what is seen, Uldin died of blood loss from a wound to his neck, and Salome shows signs of burns surpassing the third degree.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	37	"[what]"
act2_10865111		There's swelling at her neck and spine; possibly a fracture. Both of them died at around the same time, shortly before they entered the room to witness the gruesome scenario.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	39	"[what]"
act2_1f759073	il	(Could Salome have survived that attack, even for just a moment?)	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	41	il "[what]"
act2_70fb4fdb		Ilona looks around the room, seeing the scorched walls and destroyed tapestries and paintings.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	43	"[what]"
act2_d7169acc	il	(Apparently, Uldin was capable of using fire magic. Did Salome get caught in his attack? I can't really imagine that happening.)	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	45	il "[what]"
act2_a87ccfba		Ilona tries to find anything else in the room that could have been used. On the nightstand, there's a candle turned over. Droplets of now hard wax marred the wood surface. 	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	47	"[what]"
act2_41798f3f		The burns scorching the wall and room seem too significant to come from just a candle. Near the bed, and on the floor are traces of fur. Some of it is burnt.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	49	"[what]"
act2_bfd7a8eb	an	Anything out of place?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	51	an "[what]"
act2_0fbb5ea1	il	There's traces of fur, but that's about it. What about the other rooms?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	53	il "[what]"
act2_65c3c4a4	an	Eisleigh told me there was something that felt out of place in Fleur's room.I'll also let you look through Salome's room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	55	an "[what]"
act2_afe0cce4		Ilona decides to look in Salome's room first, the room closest to the master's chambers. The room is bright, orderly and spacious; and partly serves as the lady's study.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	61	"[what]"
act2_d6e770de		The most prominent part of the room is a writing table, items left strewn upon it as though she was in the middle of an important task.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	63	"[what]"
act2_836cf9c3	il	She asked you to go over the events of the day with her, after she met with us. I assume you came to her room, Anari?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	65	il "[what]"
act2_6c689b85	an	Correct. I gave my report about seeing you and Edwin for the lady's record-keeping.The one thing that's not where it should be is the chest. Though…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	67	an "[what]"
act2_6cb267c5	il	What is it? Please, don't hold back.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	69	il "[what]"
act2_97dc4de9	an	I don't think it has anything to do with the murders. That chest is meant for Fleur when she is married. Salome had it made recently.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	71	an "[what]"
act2_b97fa281	an	It's natural she might have moved it since I was last here. She does worry about Fleur's future, after all… Salome was still considering which items should go inside. 	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	73	an "[what]"
act2_7bf291bc		It surprises Ilona that Anari became so candid at this moment. Salome and Anari were closer in age, and it made sense that Anari acted as Salome's confidant.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	75	"[what]"
act2_00c7a59d		They then move to investigate Fleur's room. Ilona couldn't help but be curious about what Anari said earlier. Opening the young girl's room, both of them notice a distinct lump in the bed.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	79	"[what]"
act2_2955ea8e		Ilona looks to Anari. They agree silently to move closer.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	81	"[what]"
act2_438b2537		Anari did not pay any heed to the room's whimsical decor, but Ilona can't help but steal glances at the spectacle of floral and woodland motifs in her belongings as they pass through.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	83	"[what]"
act2_1beb9037		Last night, Ilona never thought too much of Fleur's fascination with strange and mythic tales, especially regarding the fair folk.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	85	"[what]"
act2_b7e7a782		She thought it to be just a passing interest. Her room speaks otherwise; the girl seems utterly devoted to tales of fantasy.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	87	"[what]"
act2_35de39d4		When they reach the bed, Ilona isn't sure what to expect. Anari remains behind her, and nods for Ilona to pull back the covers. Ilona could see something that looked like it's carved from wood…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	89	"[what]"
act2_bbd614a6		It resembles a wood statue, or an effigy.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	91	"[what]"
act2_65a9b3d6		The face looks eerily like Fleur, her expression mysterious; neither happy or sad. The rest of the body looks as though it remains trapped inside a still-living tree.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	93	"[what]"
act2_844c4a58	an	Impossible…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	95	an "[what]"
act2_2e1fdea2		Anari does not say anything else, but moves back from the effigy. Her hand is balled into a fist, and is shaking, either from rage or fear.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	97	"[what]"
act2_fc8145db	an	I-I've seen quite enough. I don't want to remain in this ghastly room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	99	an "[what]"
act2_1b16204f		She turns immediately on her heel. The sudden reaction surprises Ilona, and she is unsure whether to follow or not.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	101	"[what]"
act2_d9182ec8		Finding nothing else of note in the room, Ilona rejoins Anari. She finds Anari with her back pressed to the wall, steadily taking deep breaths.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	103	"[what]"
act2_62509399		For a woman who seemed to fear nothing, Ilona couldn't fathom why Anari looked so scared at that moment.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	105	"[what]"
act2_fa8f7fd5	il	Anari… you don’t look too well. I think we should pause our investigation for the moment.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	109	il "[what]"
act2_e741ca1b	il	Umm… would you like some tea?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	111	il "[what]"
act2_3f2c1808	an	...Tea?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	113	an "[what]"
act2_d7aa7db6	an	Sister, does it look like I’m in the mood for some tea right now? In the middle of this mess? Is there something wrong with your head, Sister? Have you forgotten the situation we find ourselves in?…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	115	an "[what]"
act2_28272276	an	Or are you trying to lace my drink with-	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	117	an "[what]"
act2_b88e45d0	il	I can assure you, it’s none of that. I want to find the culprit as much as you do. But I’ll need your help for that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	119	il "[what]"
act2_09c19195	il	I only wish to see that you’re in good health to proceed, so I thought we could take a quick break-	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	121	il "[what]"
act2_c57b0d6a	an	With some tea, I get it. Very well, I must tell you that I despise the leavesfrom this country, so you'd better make a damn fine cup.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	123	an "[what]"
act2_1a73e2d2	il	Are there any to your taste?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	125	il "[what]"
act2_81f8daf0	an	…Fine black tea, with bitter orange. I think Uldin still had some in his pantry.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	131	an "[what]"
act2_0c8d636a		Both of them fall silent. There is nobody in the house who can say what to do with Uldin's possessions… Anari isn't even sure if he left a will.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	133	"[what]"
act2_a9f68539		Uldin isn't around anymore to enjoy what he had in life, that is certain.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	135	"[what]"
act2_d2ea9a52		Anari goes into the pantry and finds some tea bricks sealed in a container. She was sure that last night, Salome and Fleur did talk about this kind of tea.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	137	"[what]"
act2_69b40299		Ilona, feeling some remorse as though the two of them were bandits, prepares the deceased man's tea according to Anari's instruction. Trying her best to be hospitable, Ilona also serves it with milk and sugar, as Fleur did.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	139	"[what]"
act2_2b8ffe1c	il	Here you go. Please, have some.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	141	il "[what]"
act2_08758ff0		Ilona serves tea to Anari. As expected, Anari does not take any of the milk or sugar. In contrast, Ilona puts a generous amount of both in hers. The taste was far too bitter for her to enjoy so early in the morning.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	143	"[what]"
act2_6e353178		Anari leans back in her chair, closing her eyes and taking in the aroma. She takes a sip before putting her tea cup down elegantly, without even the slightest clatter.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	145	"[what]"
act2_5157e0c6		Ilona follows suit, but she is not nearly as graceful. Anari rubs her temples with the tips of her fingers, before speaking again.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	147	"[what]"
act2_a9185d84	an	Not bad. Tell me, are all nuns this annoying?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	149	an "[what]"
act2_ff3eb2a5	il	Pardon me?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	151	il "[what]"
act2_8ddf271f	an	Whatever you're trying to do is futile. Re-examining the corpses or the rooms won't change anything — Edwin was the one who killed them.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	153	an "[what]"
act2_3188e408	il	What makes you so sure of that?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	155	il "[what]"
act2_88105179	an	I heard the details from Kellac and Eisleigh.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	157	an "[what]"
act2_a87a02e2		Anari details how the events played out: Salome screamed. It was heard by Kellac and Ilona, sleeping on the floor below. Edwin was not in his room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	159	"[what]"
act2_37aca9f5		Therefore, Edwin was already inside the master's chambers at the time of the murder.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	161	"[what]"
act2_b36ddfae		It took some time to make it to the servants quarters and the other guest lodgings, which are on the opposite end of the manse.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	163	"[what]"
act2_ce21cafd	an	Everyone's locations were accounted for:	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	165	an "[what]"
act2_197896ba	an	I was on patrol as the head of the town guard.Kellac was the first one to react to the scream, followed by you.Eisleigh was in her room.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	167	an "[what]"
act2_c0610e4e	an	Each of us were able to confirm each others' locations at the time of the murder. The only one who couldn't be found was Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	169	an "[what]"
act2_b1182eb0	il	How do you suppose that everyone is saying the absolute truth?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	171	il "[what]"
act2_3606f234	il	Kellac could have acted as if he had witnessed the murder. We have no account of what he was doing before that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	173	il "[what]"
act2_a6b8729f	il	There was also nobody around to confirm that Eisleigh was not at the crime scene, and I found her alone.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	175	il "[what]"
act2_7cf5e47d	il	And finally, where was Fleur? You do understand where I’m coming from, yes?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	177	il "[what]"
act2_c058bd63	an	...I do. You’re smarter than you look, nun.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	179	an "[what]"
act2_99727537	an	Indeed, Fleur was missing at the time of the murder. Nobody had seen her enter, or exit the manse. I'll give you that much, but I highly doubt she could be the murderer. She's far too frail.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	181	an "[what]"
act2_bc9f11d5	il	The door was destroyed in the time it took for Eisleigh and I to return. How do you explain that?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	183	il "[what]"
act2_ab37f32e	an	Does the door being destroyed really mean anything? It doesn't change the fact that Edwin was at the crime scene. Transformed.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	185	an "[what]"
act2_e72bef98	il	…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	187	il "[what]"
act2_7547d6ac	an	Let me cue you in on this: out of everyone around here, you and Edwin are the most suspicious.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	189	an "[what]"
act2_9a8501bb	an	The two of you are outsiders, whereas we’ve all known each other for a long time.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	191	an "[what]"
act2_d2b8d62f	an	I don't plan on letting my bias against the two of you get the better of me, however. Let's start at the beginning: what could be the motivation for the murder?.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	193	an "[what]"
act2_da3af864	an	Kellac was an associate of Uldin and I during the war. He’s selfless, to the point of stupidity. I guess serving as a medic will do that to you.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	195	an "[what]"
act2_1d2753ad	an	It’s hard to admit this, but I consider Kellac to be a close friend. He is a kind-hearted man.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	197	an "[what]"
act2_fb621bfa	an	But that is no reason for letting him off the hook. He simply… has no reason for murder.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	199	an "[what]"
act2_7a0a93e8	il	Please explain.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	201	il "[what]"
act2_fb24e969	an	He’s as kind as he is weak, so I doubt he could overpower both Uldin and Salome. Anything he could have ever needed, whether coin or rare books on magic, he could have simply asked Uldin.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	203	an "[what]"
act2_095f72ca	an	And Uldin wouldn't have hesitated, because they share quite the history.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	205	an "[what]"
act2_e53f12e4	an	Although, one thing I can tell you for sure is: Kellac is hiding something. Before he settled here, he had done nothing but walk and regret for five years, or so he says. It keeps him up at night.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	207	an "[what]"
act2_d8432e9c	an	Whether it’s related to this case, I do not know.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	209	an "[what]"
act2_98c0a3b9	il	Hmm… I see.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	211	il "[what]"

act2_40d902f0	an	She acted as an assistant to Salome; to help with keeping the town running, organization and tasks.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	215	an "[what]"
act2_1a63d1e4	an	She's been doing her fair share of blunders lately, but I know she takes her job seriously… Perhaps she's just daydreaming more.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	217	an "[what]"
act2_494d64f0	an	I'm not saying that she's incompetent, let me get that straight. As long as her clumsiness doesn't get in my way.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	219	an "[what]"

act2_2c7b7ea2		Ilona grimaces. Too much time was lost. She moves her arms slowly, her body heavy. Sensation comes back into the tips of her fingers, and the unpleasant tingling stops. The smell of herbal medicine starts to become more bearable to her senses.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	335	"[what]"

act2_f699bf97	il	It seems you and Anari know each other well. I don't have much time, but I need to ask:	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	353	il "[what]"
act2_f3f8762f	il	She had an extreme reaction upon seeing a wooden statue resembling Fleur. What could have terrified her so much about it?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	355	il "[what]"
act2_4614bf01	ke	Truth be told, I don't really know much about her history, only rumours. She must think that the statue has to do something with the fae — Something in her past made her be wary of them.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	357	ke "[what]"
act2_e2ea97d4	ke	Fleur admires the fair folk. The wooden statue is too elaborate to be one of Fleur's pranks, especially with the death of her parents…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	359	ke "[what]"
act2_621eaf97	il	So her aversion to seeing the statue has to do with her trauma, and distaste for Fleur's fae-related tricks?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	361	il "[what]"
act2_945c576d	ke	Something like that. Anari hates being pitied, and she doesn't show pity for anyone else either.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	363	ke "[what]"
act2_64dddb6c	ke	She would be terrified at the thought of Fleur being spirited away by the fair folk. It's not something that she could ever accept - That's probably why she is leading the search.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	365	ke "[what]"
act2_eb99b976		Ilona shifts her body off the bed, able to move freely again. Kellac invites her to take a seat at the hall, and Ilona does so. He pours her some clear water. The smell of a simmering stew wafts from the kitchen.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	367	"[what]"
act2_d3a16e59	ke	About the tea you had with Anari — was there anything odd about it? I'm asking because before the banquet, I gave Uldin his medicine, a powerful soporific.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	369	ke "[what]"
act2_40695a63	ke	There were three less doses in the pantry when I checked.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	371	ke "[what]"
act2_02696b2e	il	Then, you think someone last night—	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	373	il "[what]"
act2_cab4523c		There's a light knock on the door. Kellac tells them to enter, it's Eisleigh.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	375	"[what]"
act2_f370f571	ei	Oh, Ilona — I heard you fainted in the town square. I was worried.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	377	ei "[what]"
act2_b2e65d67	ke	Ah, yes! I invited Eisleigh over for lunch. Ilona, you probably haven't eaten at all yet, have you? You should try to eat, even if it's just a little.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	379	ke "[what]"
act2_e72bef98_3	il	…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	381	il "[what]"

act2_d9c2ae1f	il	No, it's fine… I'll eat with you. You're right, I probably can't do much if I don't take care of myself.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	385	il "[what]"
act2_787c1582		Kellac serves Eisleigh and Ilona a rustic stew, with dark bread and clear water on the side. During the time eating together, Eisleigh asks about the investigation, and Ilona repeats Anari's reasoning surrounding Eisleigh and Kellac.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	387	"[what]"
act2_16e577b6		Ilona would have thought that Anari's defense was unbreakable, but there was actually one new thing they learnt about last night…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	389	"[what]"
act2_bd132cf0	il	So are you considering the possibility someone tried to drug us during the banquet?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	391	il "[what]"
act2_75d56eb9	ke	That's what I feared, at least. Anari and I left before that, so I don't really have a clear picture of what exactly happened.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	393	ke "[what]"
act2_1b424062		Ilona stares at an empty teacup in the room, and then realizes something — if the tea she served Anari was different, but she used the same sugar from last night—	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	395	"[what]"
act2_4134c7c6	il	The sugar — it must have been tampered with! Last night, I didn't add any to my tea because I didn't want to be rude, but I took some when I had tea with Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	397	il "[what]"
act2_475b5892	ei	I remember Fleur was reallyinsistent on putting sugar in my tea. I did think that was weird.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	399	ei "[what]"
act2_6b9f322d	ke	How much sugar did you put in your tea this morning, Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	401	ke "[what]"
act2_1c4e73e0	il	Four spoonfuls…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	403	il "[what]"
act2_b3a05db6	ei	Uhh, that sure is a lot…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	405	ei "[what]"
act2_2355cd05	ke	Goodness, no wonder you were out for so long! I'm surprised Anari didn't get on your case for adding tea to your cup of sugar.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	407	ke "[what]"
act2_fe2eb6e7	ei	I think we can confirm this theory to be true then: someone was trying to put us into a deep sleep - and there's a chance they were trying to target Edwin specifically.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	409	ei "[what]"
act2_cd5dc58d	il	Then that would implicate Salome, or Fleur, most likely. They were the ones who prepared the tea last night.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	411	il "[what]"
act2_c7a44575	ei	It's not like I can deny it, but...	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	413	ei "[what]"
act2_992d9e4b	ke	Uldin could be involved, too.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	415	ke "[what]"
act2_179ffb84	ke	The truth is… the medicine he uses is made to look inconspicuous on purpose.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	417	ke "[what]"
act2_37da9ee8	ke	I never inquired too closely about it, but he comes from a rather unscrupulous family; it wouldn't surprise me if he was aware of this plot.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	419	ke "[what]"
act2_e5b5fd68		Kellac seems to know the most about Uldin's family and his circumstances, so Ilona asked for more information.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	421	"[what]"
act2_fc2e31cf		Uldin suffered from insomnia, and slept in separate arrangements so as to not disturb his wife. Last night was also one of the rare occasions when Uldin was back in town, as he travelled frequently for his research; studying magic.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	423	"[what]"
act2_5534675e		On the topic of magic, Eisleigh recalls something that she needed to discuss.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	425	"[what]"
act2_183afa6c	ei	Could you tell us more about how Edwin is able to transform into a werewolf? Have you ever seen him do it?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	427	ei "[what]"
act2_04e64114	il	No, I haven't. When he transforms, even when I ask it of him, he tells me to look away or to close my eyes.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	429	il "[what]"
act2_9b1b4cae	ke	Wait, why do you ask him to transform? What do you do when he's a werewolf?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	431	ke "[what]"
act2_85be9de6	il	It's… a secret.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	433	il "[what]"

act2_e9b634cd		Everyone else looks at Eisleigh in alarm.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	437	"[what]"
act2_ba1a2029	ei	I heard of shapechangers before while studying cursed objects. They would use either an ointment, or the pelt of an animal, to assume the form of a beast.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	441	ei "[what]"
act2_f35a5c3d	ei	If the curse was tied to his body, he wouldn't fear you witnessing his transformation.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	443	ei "[what]"
act2_c5aa73b5	ei	But what if it was an item? If he feared betrayal, he wouldn't even show it to an ally.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	445	ei "[what]"
act2_bfc74a00	ei	Besides, there's always a risk involved in keeping that item safe — so it is better that only the bearer knows of it, because it could get lost, destroyed, or...	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	447	ei "[what]"
act2_0ff42dad	il	… stolen.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	449	il "[what]"
act2_851d31ba		Both Kellac and Ilona look at Eisleigh with tense faces. Ilona isn't sure what to be more surprised at: Eisleigh's incredible reasoning and knowledge, or that someone would go as far as to steal an item uncertain to be in Edwin's possession.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	451	"[what]"
act2_f8d26d7a	ei	There is a high chance that this cursed item still exists. Had it been destroyed, he would have died along with it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	453	ei "[what]"
act2_32bcef57	ei	This would give us a reason as to why Edwin was drugged last night: Uldin and Salome are sharp, and they might have caught onto Edwin being a werewolf early on.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	455	ei "[what]"
act2_cd9c659d	il	If we return this item to Edwin, would it restore the transformed arms back to human form?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	457	il "[what]"
act2_9a419297	ei	It's entirely possible, if that's what controls the transformation. A cursed item like that can generally only be bound to one person.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	459	ei "[what]"
act2_5a88d707	ei	Someone else could have also used it, but… Uldin would understand the consequences of such a thing. I highly doubt it would be him.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	461	ei "[what]"
act2_03c42b08	ke	Even so, finding this item might lead us to finding the true culprit, or at least help make sense of this tragedy…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	463	ke "[what]"
act2_d29f2f6e	ke	You might not be able to convince everyone that Edwin is innocent, otherwise.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	465	ke "[what]"
act2_d5d5ecb4	il	Yes, Anari wouldn't accept it so easily... What would it take to convince her of Edwin's innocence?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	467	il "[what]"
act2_87bf1c2e	ke	Short of having the culprit confess their crime, or finding Fleur in hope for an answer… I don't know.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	469	ke "[what]"
act2_58fd6f2a		The three of them start their search for the cursed item. Based on Anari's report, Kellac confirms with Ilona that nobody was able to enter or exit the town after Ilona and Edwin entered.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	473	"[what]"
act2_13b633c9		Eisleigh was eager to help out in any way possible, now that there was a chance of witnessing or finding a cursed magical object.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	475	"[what]"

act2_eda8c732	ei	I used to be a thief before I came here. The reason why I was an assistant to this household, was because I tried to steal one of Uldin's rare books…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	479	ei "[what]"
act2_181e78b6	ei	However, I've put the past well behind me. Uldin made me his friend instead of punishing me, and I'm thankful for that.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	481	ei "[what]"
act2_3185af9e		Ilona can’t help but find this suspicious. They start their search around Uldin's chambers. Once again, they see the mutilated corpse of Uldin, and the corpse of Salome, burned beyond recognition…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	483	"[what]"
act2_9538cd64		Despite thoroughly searching the bodies, the trio was unable to find the wolfskin or anything else of importance.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	485	"[what]"
act2_8292a09c		They move onto Salome's room. Nothing appears to have been touched since the last time Ilona was here with Anari. Like Anari, Eisleigh comments that the chest was moved and then moves to inspect it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	487	"[what]"
act2_15d6eaa6	ei	This chest… Last time I saw it, it wasn’t locked. Salome was still re-arranging it to look nice.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	489	ei "[what]"

act3_8fb82fa7		I could only choose one or the other, and so I have decided to take a test of faith to prove my worthiness.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	181	"[what]"
act3_fdb0c563		Ilona decides that they should at least begin with what they know from the investigation, and think about Fleur's letter along the way.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	183	"[what]"
act3_9be24994	il	This murder had at least two conspirators involved: Salome and Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	185	il "[what]"

act3_e74b8f23	il	Both Salome and Fleur conspired together to drug the guests at the banquet, by poisoning the sugar with a powerful soporific.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	189	il "[what]"
act3_3373944c	il	This was given to Uldin by Kellac last night as part of his medicine to aid his sleeplessness. Kellac has confirmed three doses of this medicine disappeared from his dispensary.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	191	il "[what]"
act3_ef73d5b4	il	During the banquet, Fleur and Salome were able to figure out Edwin's true nature, and thought to drug him by lacing the sugar with the soporific. When Edwin was asleep, they were able to steal a cursed item from him, and assume the form of a werewolf.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	193	il "[what]"
act3_5e958068	an	All I care about are the deaths themselves at the end of the day. So? Who was the one that murdered Uldin?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	195	an "[what]"
act3_28c04eee		Ilona thinks carefully about the course of events, and what she really saw.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	197	"[what]"

act3_fa62cd70	il	How were you able to identify the burned corpse in the Master's chamber?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	207	il "[what]"
act3_2ccdf9e7	an	Her skin was charred beyond recognition, so we had to resort to what remained of her hair and dress to determine it was Salome.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	209	an "[what]"
act3_0bd32bb9	il	Did Salome have any identifying features on her body? Anything that could be used to set her apart?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	211	il "[what]"
act3_01dcf84e	an	Nothing that I know of, apart from the mole near her eye… And as I said, her face has been horribly burned — 	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	213	an "[what]"
act3_18dc2264	il	Then, here's my answer for who murdered Uldin: the culprit was Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	215	il "[what]"

act3_eae1244c	an	What? How dare you doubt Kellac's judgement? You must be truly grasping at straws to make such bold claims! !	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	218	an "[what]"
act3_24b645b9	il	You said the corpse's face, hair and body was burned to an unrecognizable state. The only identifiers we had were Salome's ring, and her nightgown - all clothing and effects.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	220	il "[what]"
act3_7d79c9df	il	I insist: this is Fleur's body.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	222	il "[what]"
act3_6b36032f	an	Say we believe for one second we mistook one corpse for another — why Fleur? Why would she ever want to murder her own father?!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	224	an "[what]"
act3_6d8f118d	il	I don't have all the details… This is only a theory if the letter's contents can be believed. Her letter read: I will strike terror into the one who has abandoned me.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	226	il "[what]"
act3_371c36f7	il	Fleur's letter talks about choosing her true family. Uldin is not frequently in this town, is he? He has essentially abandoned his daughter.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	228	il "[what]"
act3_bfc261b8	il	Only the guests were drugged that night — but not Uldin, herself or her mother. She needed him awake to scare him. As luck would have it, Edwin had the cursed item needed for transformation into a werewolf.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	230	il "[what]"
act3_5b9cf577	il	Her mother was assisting her in this plot. Fleur never intended to kill, she only wished to scare Uldin, perhaps to convince him to change his behaviour.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	232	il "[what]"
act3_98ac740c	il	She assumed the form of a werewolf, Uldin's worst fear.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	234	il "[what]"
act3_478db448	il	She wore her mother's ring, perhaps to prove she had permission if found wandering at night… As you know, Fleur is fond of pranks and tricks. What better night than All Hallow's Eve?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	236	il "[what]"
act3_3ee5a633	an	I refuse to believe this… This is all far too absurd.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	238	an "[what]"
act3_3cca3312	il	A werewolf has considerable strength, even more than a beast, but it doesn't make you impervious to all attack.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	240	il "[what]"
act3_765a3351	il	Terrified by such a horrible sight, Uldin did not hesitate to burn Fleur with magic, and driven mad by the pain, she killed him by biting his throat.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	242	il "[what]"
act3_6ddf0c79	il	You may have believed she was taken by the fair folk, but this would explain why you were unable to find her; or even to glimpse any trace of her - she was already dead.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	244	il "[what]"
act3_e20637ab	an	Then how do you explain Fleur's letter? Or the wooden effigy of her that appeared in her bed?!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	246	an "[what]"
act3_fd1c478f	il	I've already laid the evidence bare: there was more than one conspirator. Even taking the cursed item out of the equation, Salome was surely aware that there was a sedated monster in her house. And I strongly believe that she encouraged Fleur to do this 'prank' on her father.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	248	il "[what]"
act3_83f73ac6	il	Salome must have screamed to clear suspicion from herself, and hid in the master's chamber. At that point, Edwin was looking for his stolen item. He broke down the door and found Fleur's body.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	250	il "[what]"
act3_6309b60e	an	How dare you — You have no idea how much Salome loved her daughter! She'd never abandon her like that!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	252	an "[what]"
act3_c58a4fd8	il	I wouldn't be so quick to discount the possibility. We found a chest made for Fleur in Salome's room. When Eisleigh opened it, she suffered a horrific injury from a trap. Perhaps Salome had the trap for some time, and her target was Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	254	il "[what]"
act3_3af103db		Anari remains silent, but her glare is penetrating and cold. Despite this, Ilona continues.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	256	"[what]"
act3_89c77cf9	il	After the murder, she waited patiently until the manse was empty. After we escorted Edwin to the dungeon and gathered in the town square, Salome was able to move again. She locked the wolfskin away in a chest in her room, setting the trap.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	258	il "[what]"
act3_d5fbc31b	il	She waited patiently until the manse was empty. After we escorted Edwin to the dungeon and gathered in the town square, Salome was able to move again. She locked the wolfskin away in a chest in her room, and trapped it with a device.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	260	il "[what]"
act3_03bc49f9	il	Salome placed the statue in Fleur's bed to make it seem like she was spirited away by the fair folk. This statue fits the description of this receipt I found in Salome's room. Here.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	262	il "[what]"
act3_0f8a941a		Ilona hands Anari the paper she found in the chest. Upon realizing that it explains the existence of the wooden statue of Fleur, she looks thoroughly displeased, nearly crumpling the document.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	264	"[what]"
act3_d6109fd5	il	Fleur must have had some suspicion this plan was risky, so she wrote a short letter. If she succeeded in her prank, all she had to do was destroy it.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	266	il "[what]"
act3_e9a1d96a	il	In fact, since the letter was found still sealed, I would suspect Salome encouraged Fleur to write it. To make Fleur's disappearance seem more credible, she placed it in the forest after her escape.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	268	il "[what]"
act3_05ef1a68	il	Not only did Salome orchestrate this parricide. She survived.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	270	il "[what]"
act3_89229ecd		Anari crosses her arms, and her brows knit together as she takes in Ilona's theory.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	272	"[what]"
act3_ae74637f	an	You're forgetting something. You never explained what Edwin did in that room when he found the burned body. If I were him, I'd hide rather than stay out in the open. Why was he holding the body in his arms?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	274	an "[what]"
act3_d0430801		Ilona freezes, her legs shaking. The words are caught in her throat again. As she sees this, Anari chuckled to herself.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	276	"[what]"
act3_a68540b4	an	You really are awful at keeping secrets. There's no need to talk — I can already tell just by looking at you.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	279	an "[what]"
act3_aa677a44		Ilona’s proposition is met with mumblings, grumblings, dissatisfied grunts and a few voices of support from the townsfolk. However, it’s all drowned out in the eyes and minds of both Ilona and Anari-	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	283	"[what]"
act3_763ef30c		Ilona is shivering, as the warm rays of sun accentuate the bags under her eyes. Tired. Broken. But still standing.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	285	"[what]"
act3_6b036077		It’s impossible to say what Anari might be thinking right now. Her posture unflinching, the totality of her being in complete focus. She asks the crowd to simmer down, her usual aura of conceit fading away.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	287	"[what]"
act3_481c44e0		There is now only one question that remains-and a clocktower that's ticking away, endlessly.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	289	"[what]"
act3_f6c8e5f3	an	So where is she? Where is Salome?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	291	an "[what]"
act3_7a03d6f3	il	That, I can't tell you. I'm certain that my theory is correct, however.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	293	il "[what]"
act3_27727842	il	I do not care what happens next, Anari. Whether you believe me or not is irrelevant. I've only tried to make sense of what I could from this tragedy.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	295	il "[what]"
act3_521f26a6	il	You cannot make me feel guilt for harbouring Edwin as a werewolf. He is not defined by his curse, and I want you to see that.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	297	il "[what]"
act3_32de3dab	il	I have provided evidence and my theory, as you asked. Nothing I do now can change your mind. I accept it, regardless of the outcome.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	299	il "[what]"
act3_de35f27f	an	Sister, I would like to believe you. More than anyone else, believe it or not. Why, however…	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	301	an "[what]"
act3_4e6c5686	an	Well, maybe I can tell you some other time. If we even get a chance that is. In your mind, you may be right...	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	303	an "[what]"
act3_d2c2e98b	an	But unless you bring Salome to me, I will not be convinced. The ‘righteousness’ that you preach is meaningless without tangible proof. So, where is Salome? We searched everywhere in this town for her daughter.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	305	an "[what]"
act3_58f17a7b	il	I can only speculate at this point. Are there any secret or hidden passages in Belorov?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	307	il "[what]"
act3_404747d0	an	That would be far too convenient, wouldn't it? You are right: nothing you do will change my mind. I have been burned by blindly trusting others in the past more times and in worse ways than you could ever imagine.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	309	an "[what]"
act3_0cb31cca	an	If I am wrong, so be it. When my time comes, I’ll gladly accept my penance.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	311	an "[what]"
act3_0da409a7	an	There's one thing that's certain: your arrival into this town brought with it the destruction of this family.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	313	an "[what]"
act3_ae052f9a	an	If it weren't for you and Edwin, this tragedy would never have happened.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	315	an "[what]"
act3_deeba605	il	You're blaming us for being caught in a plot that we had no part in? You have done nothing but look for reasons to kill Edwin all along. For all I know, maybe you planned for this to happen, to usurp power in Belorov.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	317	il "[what]"
act3_40a3acb0	an	Hahahahaha! I didn't know nuns could tell jokes. As if I would ever wish for such a thing.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	319	an "[what]"
act3_54c3efb5	an	You should learn to choose your words more wisely, Sister. It's unbecoming of a holy woman… but I had the nagging suspicion you were a heretic from the first moment I saw you. Someone like you could never win.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	321	an "[what]"
act3_d4869ea8		With a signal of Anari's hand, two town guards move in on Ilona and grip her arms tightly; drawing them behind her back. The men tried to bind Ilona's hands together with thick rope.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	323	"[what]"
act3_8bf2e26b	il	Aaaaaaaahh! Let me go!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	325	il "[what]"
act3_f9f6e9cc		Ilona struggles and tries to shake the men off, but the guards do not relent. One grabs her by the hair. Edwin cannot abide by this any longer. He transforms, the chains snapping off him as he transforms into a massive wolf-man.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	327	"[what]"
act3_d1c4f64b		He rushes at the guards with a growl, knocking them over by slamming against them. He throws them off with both fang and claw, prying Ilona away from them.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	329	"[what]"
act3_541fb219		Anari did not expect this development. She strings her bow, and takes an arrow from her quiver. She trains it on the werewolf.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	331	"[what]"
act3_5ce66e66	an	I won't let you escape.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	333	an "[what]"
act3_0887ff34		When she releases the bowstring, a piercing, otherworldly whistle cries out from her weapon. It misses. The arrow grazes Edwin's fur as he transforms from half-man, half-wolf, into an enormous grey wolf.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	335	"[what]"
act3_56e4d344		He continues to run on all fours, with only Ilona to guide him. She adjusts herself on his back, grasping tufts of thick fur. Anari scowls, and then goes to climb a tower to gain a higher vantage point.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	337	"[what]"
act3_45b0b7a3	il	The gates will be already closed by now. There's a part of the wall that was hastily patched up. You should be able to climb through there.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	339	il "[what]"
act3_083a3495		Edwin takes a running leap, and latches his claws into the stone wall. He shifts back into his half-wolf form and starts climbing.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	341	"[what]"
act3_3ca555b8		The looming stone wall in front of them is a substantial hurdle to overcome. The town guards mobilise, firing arrows that torrent Edwin and Ilona. Edwin does his best to throw off their aim.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	345	"[what]"
act3_61ab196c		There is one he cannot escape from. Anari's skill with a bow is frightening, her gaze ever calm and steady.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	347	"[what]"
act3_b30d1449		Two arrows finally meet its target. They pierce his side, fired in rapid succession. Then three more pierce his ribs. This isn’t a problem for the werewolf, as he brushes aside the pain. He’s taken greater beatings than this.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	349	"[what]"
act3_f8041008		However, he’s not invincible; a few more well placed shots and he’s down, along with Ilona.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	351	"[what]"
act3_6a6a0659	il	Stay with me Edwin! Don’t lose sight of our escape. I’ll do my best to heal your wounds with- Ah!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	353	il "[what]"
act3_f73bcc78		An arrow pierces the hand with which Ilona was trying to use to heal. Her hand twists and contorts, reflexingly convulsing due to the writhing pain.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	355	"[what]"
act3_365edd5c	ed	Ilona! Ho-hold on, we’re almost there!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	357	ed "[what]"
act3_feb0ae5a		Time seems to move too slowly. How much more pain can they accept? Edwin grimaces past the pain of his sustained wounds.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	359	"[what]"
act3_1e2814b6		There’s no question about it - Ilona knows Anari could never miss her mark, not with a target so large. She’s missing their vitals on purpose.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	361	"[what]"
act3_093385e9		A good look at Anari leaves nothing more than questions. Does she want to let them leave? Or capture and burn them at the stake alive?	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	363	"[what]"
act3_f83c2d15		Her intentions remain unclear, as one final arrow impales Ilona in the back, shooting through her cleanly.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	365	"[what]"
act3_d4c4b40e		With a light scream, Ilona loses her footing. There's only one hand she could use to hold onto the rough stone wall, and her fingers are slipping. Blood stains her white dress from the hole it left behind, and she can feel it drip down on the wall.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	367	"[what]"
act3_66587697	ed	Ilona! No!	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	369	ed "[what]"
act3_61005784		Edwin is quick to react, as he pulls her over while climbing over the wall; carrying her carefully, as though holding an injured bird.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	371	"[what]"
act3_77fbda76		The stone wall they escaped over is dyed red with their blood. Yet they make it out of Belorov, despite their injuries.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	373	"[what]"
act3_52cc6caa		Edwin marches on, with Ilona in his arms. It’s too dangerous to be out in the open. They search for a place to rest, as dusk greets them with open arms.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	377	"[what]"
act3_9d70f41b		Ilona heals the wound that pierced her abdomen through, and the blood slows. However, the wound does not close completely. The other arrows stuck in them would prove more dangerous to deal with, with no surgical equipment to use.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	379	"[what]"
