act1_3ee951fc	il	We should think of finding shelter soon, before it gets too dark.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	98	il "[what]"
act1_5929efd8		Ilona waits for Edwin to turn back into a human, closing her eyes to rest for a moment. There's only the sound of the forest until Edwin speaks to break their silence.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	102	"[what]"
act1_efb2cbb1	ed	I know that I'm asking for too much, but despite everything that's happened… would you please stay with me?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	108	ed "[what]"
act1_68dcc588	il	What? Edwin, please, calm down-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	112	il "[what]"
act1_e754ed99	ed	... Ilona I-I can’t. Not in a situation like this...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	116	ed "[what]"
act1_cab4f62c	il	You’re right, but I need you to slow down. I can’t keep up with you and that is only going to make us look all the more suspicious.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	122	il "[what]"
act1_161c342c	ed	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	124	ed "[what]"
act1_1c296b8a	il	We have only each other to rely on.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	133	il "[what]"
act1_46e0d11b		As she says this, she places her hands over his. His hands are abnormally cold to touch. Ilona learned this was a sign of his transformation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	140	"[what]"
act1_b958cf55		She gently caresses his hand and strokes it soothingly.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	142	"[what]"
act1_9391265e		Despite his curse, she must remain with him.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	144	"[what]"
act1_a9c16504		The moonlight beams over them, slightly wavering with each breath they take.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	148	"[what]"
act1_821e83ae	il	(If only the moonlight would never leave us. We should rest here for a while.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	152	il "[what]"
act1_da07b632	il	Edwin…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	154	il "[what]"

act1_d3efef17	ed	Yes, I’m here. Please forgive my wandering mind.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	166	ed "[what]"
act1_c9d9e350	ed	...What could I ever do without you? I feel like I have never thanked you for-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	172	ed "[what]"
act1_3668f414	il	You have thanked me more than enough already, Edwin. I appreciate it…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	176	il "[what]"
act1_a8078a70		Their eyes flicker for a moment and he’s not shivering anymore. 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	182	"[what]"
act1_88437638		Eventually, they press on. They sight a lonely settlement on the horizon; stone walls surround its perimeter.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	190	"[what]"
act1_174e03cb	ed	Heh…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	195	ed "[what]"
act1_fe98e4f3	ed	I haven't felt like m-myself lately, since the incident back at the priory. Try as I may to blend in, to do good and keep myself in check… I am a beast, through and through.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	199	ed "[what]"
act1_498796b3	ed	What is it that we've done wrong? Is us being together something so heinous? Is my existence such a sin?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	203	ed "[what]"
act1_4e05bc5f	il	...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	208	il "[what]"
act1_f0cc2f26	ed	I did not know the extent of the hatred that lay within their souls until that night… to go as far as to burn me alive…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	218	ed "[what]"
act1_bdf2c12b	ed	Is there something wrong with me, Ilona? I'm always on edge, fearing for our lives… I never meant to put you through this.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	220	ed "[what]"
act1_dc9e184e	il	If you want my answer as a former nun… You and I have sinned.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	226	il "[what]"
act1_94fcde9e	il	You said that you were a beast, through and through.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	228	il "[what]"
act1_cc29e9ed	il	You're not. You’re-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	232	il "[what]"
act1_4ce6fb1d		Edwin immediately releases her hand, intertwined seconds ago, but now balled into a fist. The rustling of dry leaves brings with it a heavily armed guard and an archer wearing a cloak.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	242	"[what]"
act1_292a0b43	unk	That's enough loitering around the town wall looking suspicious, don't you think?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	244	unk "[what]"
act1_17fa5516	unk	I've been observing your movements from the battlements for a while now. Be grateful that the town master wishes to have a meeting with you, or else I would have already pierced you with my arrows.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	251	unk "[what]"
act1_af13fa16	ed	But, we-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	256	ed "[what]"
act1_daf225eb	il	May we ask, to what purpose do we owe this pleasure?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	261	il "[what]"
act1_fb7348d7	unk	{i}Sister{/i}, all I know is that the master called you. I sighted a nun and a man outside the town walls and informed him of this.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	267	unk "[what]"
act1_59d5ebd0	unk	I can tell your legs are shaking even from here… so make sure to comply obediently and I won't ask any difficult questions about you in return.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	269	unk "[what]"
act1_a6cad620	ed	She simply asked what business the master has with us. You're acting very feisty for someone who didn't even have the decency to introduce herself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	273	ed "[what]"
act1_6928dc2b	unk	Hmph. Fair enough.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	279	unk "[what]"
act1_6cdb422e	an	My name is Anari. Happy now?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	283	an "[what]"
act1_f253981e	an	I'm not going to probe you or anything.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	286	an "[what]"
act1_a7c02d41	an	You may be outsiders, but you look like decent enough folk. No need to come up with any grand excuses for why you’re here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	288	an "[what]"
act1_e39fd1e3	an	So, let’s get back to it. Will you accept the town master's call?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	291	an "[what]"
act1_e4151a94	il	...I suppose that choice is not truly much of one. I accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	295	il "[what]"
act1_186c0269	an	A wise judgement. You’re clever for a nun, but you should learn to keep your dog in line.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	301	an "[what]"
act1_e1980f05	ed	...Excuse me?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	305	ed "[what]"
act1_4d2e1cfa	an	I don’t appreciate being called ‘feisty’.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	309	an "[what]"
act1_c42899de	ed	I meant no offense when I said that. My apologies.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	315	ed "[what]"
act1_97971ac5	an	So you do have manners; it would do you well to keep them. Let’s get moving, then. I’ll escort you to the manse.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	319	an "[what]"
act1_fad72934		Anari takes the position of rear guard, as the other guard leads the way forward.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	326	"[what]"
act1_c33914e7		Ilona glances back, just once. Anari's bow is by her side and a hand rests on the quiver, ready to fire if the two of them even thought of escaping.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	330	"[what]"
act1_840eb37c		Ilona cannot help but wonder just how much of their conversation Anari overheard... Her arrival seemed too well-timed.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	332	"[what]"
act1_bd728716		Did they give away too much, even when they thought they were alone?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	334	"[what]"
act1_69a2867d		She glances at Edwin, his face inscrutable. And so, they enter the gates.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	336	"[what]"
act1_b2c677a3	ed	(When was the last time I felt any hope? Anything besides pain? The swelling in my chest is excruciating…)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	360	ed "[what]"
act1_f989775a	ed	(I truly wouldn't have made it this far on my own. Even if I hide what I am well, people can't help but to be suspicious.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	363	ed "[what]"
act1_e32c419f	ed	(Although — a town full of people not trying to kill me yet is quite an improvement.)	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	366	ed "[what]"
act1_19a7f63c		The town is bustling despite not being very large. A clock tower stands over the plaza. Small patches of land growing wheat are adjacent to the plaza and there is a stocked stable for horses nearby.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	368	"[what]"
act1_8a8d8910		There's a large bonfire in the square, and there are carved turnips at the doors of all the houses.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	370	"[what]"
act1_3a3c3fe1	il	What kind of decorations are these?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	376	il "[what]"
act1_a3084de7	ed	It’s for... All Hallows’ Eve, a celebration to commemorate the dead.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	380	ed "[what]"
act1_39fb5494	il	You mean All Saints’ Eve? Why are the townsfolk celebrating in joy, then?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	384	il "[what]"
act1_8f79b109	ed	You were raised strictly, Ilona. Father Ivanov never wanted you to know about these pagan festivals.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	390	ed "[what]"
act1_cd161ab9	ed	Oh!-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	397	ed "[what]"
act1_dad19b0c	unk	Young lad, please watch your step. One mistake and this weary old man is done for…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	403	unk "[what]"
act1_6a813be3	ed	I’m so sorry for bumping into you, sir-	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	409	ed "[what]"
act1_0c985e71	an	...Kellac, we're the same age.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	415	an "[what]"
act1_6f431cac	ke	Fancy meeting you here, Anari. I didn’t know you like to take strolls. I never knew you had friends either! And who may you be, dear sister?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	422	ke "[what]"
act1_de179210	ed	Uh, I’m not sure we're friends…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	428	ed "[what]"
act1_aaeed289	ke	Pleased to make your acquaintance, anyhow. I’m Kellac, Anari and I go way back.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	434	ke "[what]"
act1_e24e19b8	an	That we do, and I regret it.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	438	an "[what]"
act1_013bf581	ke	You’ve just got to love that personality! Don’t take her too seriously, she's always been like that.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	442	ke "[what]"
act1_8b4d669e	ed	I see… I'm Edwin. Pleased to make your acquaintance.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	447	ed "[what]"
act1_6af4c780	il	As am I. My name is Ilona. Forgive my ignorance, but are you the master of this town?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	451	il "[what]"
act1_cb0bbce6	ke	Me? Sorry, but no. I'm just the physician and herbalist. Did the master summon you?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	457	ke "[what]"
act1_8d34d888	il	He did, but I don't know what business we have with him...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	464	il "[what]"
act1_320aabaf	ke	Aha. I should have expected as much; Anari has a habit of leaving out the details and jumping straight to the point.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	471	ke "[what]"
act1_db6d3c4a	ke	I should get going, but we're bound to see each other again soon. Keep well, Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	476	ke "[what]"
act1_d0644ba6		Anari only nods curtly, and the group moves along. Further into the town, they find a large house made of timber and stone.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	482	"[what]"
act1_85b98112		Anari knocks on the door. It is answered by a man and woman in fine clothing. They step outside of the house.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	502	"[what]"
act1_df1cba86	an	Sir Uldin, Lady Salome. I've brought to you Sister Ilona, and her companion Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	512	an "[what]"
act1_6fd50c4c	ul	So the man was with her after all?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	518	ul "[what]"
act1_872e30dc	an	At first, I thought a holy woman was being accosted by some blackguard. To think that he was her travelling companion...	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	523	an "[what]"
act1_1999e055	ed	I understand I may not have the friendliest appearance… but I have sworn to protect Sister Ilona from harm.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	527	ed "[what]"
act1_12e527ef	ul	This is indeed unexpected… Anari's eyes are keen, but perhaps only for hunting her quarry.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	531	ul "[what]"
act1_757ba920	an	True. There's no need to understand the conversations of beasts to hunt them, only their behaviour.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	535	an "[what]"
act1_c4c96189	sa	Judging by Anari's report, I would have thought she was describing a saint!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	541	sa "[what]"
act1_0f158e72	il	Thank you for your kind words, but they are far too gracious to be wasted on me... I have not done anything to be deserving of such praise.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	546	il "[what]"
act1_be684527	sa	I thought you might be able to join us for tonight's feast for All Hallows' Eve, and to perhaps lead us in prayer.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	550	sa "[what]"
act1_d6a91bf6	ul	It’s not every day that you see a nun, and much less in such unlikely company. So, would you accept our invitation?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	555	ul "[what]"
act1_c6787679		Ilona considers this carefully. She and Edwin had drawn too much attention already. So it surprises her when Edwin speaks without any fear.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	559	"[what]"
act1_4119ed7e	ed	We will gladly accept.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	564	ed "[what]"
act1_ff47b2be	sa	Tonight's banquet will begin shortly, but you should still have time to prepare for it. Anari, let us debrief in the meantime.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	569	sa "[what]"
act1_c91bfff5		It had only been a few days since they were on the run… Ilona could scarcely believe that they were welcomed so readily.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	580	"[what]"
act1_76717860		They sit at a table laden with food: a rich coloured beetroot soup, mulled wine with spices, pickled vegetables, a glistening whole roasted pheasant and even more dishes than one could name.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	582	"[what]"
act1_fe97bc40		Seated at the table were two new faces: Fleur, the daughter of Uldin. On Fleur's left side was Eisleigh, an assistant to the house.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	591	"[what]"
act1_284ded2f		Uldin plans to rebuild the ruined chapel in Belorov, as Salome is deeply pious. This is why Salome regards the meeting with Ilona as such good fortune.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	602	"[what]"
act1_764c3b9f		As everyone gathers at the table, Uldin urges Ilona to lead them in prayer before the meal.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	628	"[what]"
act1_5e3d1d21		She speaks a few words of gratitude for the harvest and for peace and protection. When she lifts her eyes once again, the lively banquet commences.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	643	"[what]"
act1_50f8cc7d	ke	The food smells amazing. Was that the pheasant you caught today, Anari?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	659	ke "[what]"
act1_964c7e5c	an	The very one. Ahh, a successful hunt and high quality spices can put even someone like me in a good mood.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	663	an "[what]"
act1_1f1f5896	ke	You should always be in a good mood, then!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	668	ke "[what]"
act1_71f306ca	an	Heheheh. Fleur, would you like some spiced pheasant?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	675	an "[what]"
act1_853e9921	fl	Oh no, thank you, Aunt Anari. You always make it way too spicy… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	679	fl "[what]"
act1_6cf0d10b	an	That's too bad… I guess you really don't take after Uldin when it comes to food.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	684	an "[what]"
act1_25f9e941	sa	So, what brings you to Belorov, Mister Edwin and Sister Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	697	sa "[what]"
act1_35b3a49e	sa	Our town may not look like much after our chapel was ransacked and destroyed, but it was once breathtaking.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	701	sa "[what]"
act1_581943e6	il	We're… on a pilgrimage. We were just seeking shelter before dark.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	705	il "[what]"
act1_39597b73	il	I heard about the destruction of a chapel some time ago, but I had no idea it was here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	709	il "[what]"
act1_c760f5b4	sa	Yes, it was the barbarians' doing. Even now, we're still rebuilding the town, but the faithful have moved on from here.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	713	sa "[what]"
act1_17a8c2ae	sa	I miss having someone to share my connection with God, so I am sorry to impose my sudden invitation on you.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	715	sa "[what]"
act1_cc8bc172	sa	Belorov is home to people of many faiths. Many of us have travelled from afar, like myself.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	719	sa "[what]"
act1_170ca600	il	From what I understand, Edwin was also quite the traveller before we met.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	724	il "[what]"
act1_13488422	fl	Do you have any stories, Edwin? I'd love to hear them.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	729	fl "[what]"
act1_3d28723a	ed	Haha. To tell you everything that happened would tax my wits.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	733	ed "[what]"
act1_f95c2761	fl	Have you met any mythical creatures in your journeys? Ever met the fair folk?? I've always dreamed of finding one!!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	738	fl "[what]"
act1_ca698d9a	ed	Let me think. There was this one time I had an encounter with a giant… 	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	742	ed "[what]"
act1_bb33c4d9		Edwin regales the table with his tale of encountering a giant when he was atop a mountain. Fleur and Salome listen with rapturous attention.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	746	"[what]"
act1_0425f1e3		Even Kellac takes an interest in these tales and starts telling of his own travels. He loses track of time and he decides that it is getting late and he needs to head in early.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	753	"[what]"
act1_6c871926		Anari leaves to get some rest for her shift as the town guard. Both of them bid everyone at the table a good night.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	758	"[what]"
act1_00cec763		Even though the party thins out a little, Fleur seems as excitable as when she began. Even Eisleigh, who kept to herself as she ate, joins in on the conversation.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	778	"[what]"
act1_25dd3d4a	ei	You've really travelled a long way if you came from across the sea, Edwin.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	783	ei "[what]"
act1_5bdd70a9	fl	Now I'm wondering, how did you meet Sister Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	787	fl "[what]"
act1_e9d80bdc	ed	Oh uh… Heh heh. That's a story for another time. I'm pretty tired…	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	792	ed "[what]"
act1_1b4b8e1d	fl	Oh, could it be…? Is the story of how you met Ilona not suitable for my ears?	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	796	fl "[what]"
act1_2c3eeb68	ei	Ahaha, is that it? You might be onto something, Fleur.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	802	ei "[what]"

act1_3bbbf098	ed	No no no, that's not it at all! It's… not that interesting compared to my other stories.	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	816	ed "[what]"
act1_c8637b7a	fl	Hmph, I was under the impression you two shared a forbidden romance. Perhaps the strange forces that wander tonight will tip the scales at last!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	821	fl "[what]"
act1_a4709631	sa	Fleur, you shouldn't tease guests. And you really shouldn't encourage her, Eisleigh!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	825	sa "[what]"
act1_726f2495	fl	Mother, it's All Hallow's Eve! Tricks and pranks are part of the fun. I'm merely teaching Sister Ilona about this part of the festival — She shouldn't be so serious and uptight all the time!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	831	fl "[what]"
act1_9d8fd50c	ul	Well, they said they were on a pilgrimage. If their sins are meant to be forgiven in the end, they should be able to sin along the way all they want!	game/scripts/acts/act1.rpy	836	ul "[what]"

act2_f699bf97	il	It seems you and Anari know each other well. I don't have much time, but I need to ask:	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	631	il "[what]"
act2_f3f8762f	il	She had an extreme reaction upon seeing a wooden statue resembling Fleur. What could have terrified her so much about it?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	634	il "[what]"
act2_4614bf01	ke	Truth be told, I don't really know much about her history, only rumours. She must think that the statue has to do something with the fae — Something in her past made her be wary of them.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	637	ke "[what]"
act2_e2ea97d4	ke	Fleur admires the fair folk. The wooden statue is too elaborate to be one of Fleur's pranks, especially with the death of her parents…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	639	ke "[what]"
act2_621eaf97	il	So her aversion to seeing the statue has to do with her trauma, and distaste for Fleur's fae-related tricks?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	641	il "[what]"
act2_945c576d	ke	Something like that. Anari hates being pitied, and she doesn't show pity for anyone else either.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	644	ke "[what]"
act2_64dddb6c	ke	She would be terrified at the thought of Fleur being spirited away by the fair folk. It's not something that she could ever accept - That's probably why she is leading the search.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	646	ke "[what]"
act2_25c3ebf5		Ilona shifts her body off the bed, able to move freely again. Kellac invites her to take a seat, and Ilona does so. He pours her some clear water. The smell of a simmering stew wafts from the kitchen.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	650	"[what]"
act2_d3a16e59	ke	About the tea you had with Anari — was there anything odd about it? I'm asking because before the banquet, I gave Uldin his medicine, a powerful soporific.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	662	ke "[what]"
act2_40695a63	ke	There were three less doses in the pantry when I checked.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	665	ke "[what]"

act2_722a6ffe		There's a light knock on the door. Kellac tells them to enter. It's Eisleigh.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	671	"[what]"
act2_f370f571	ei	Oh, Ilona — I heard you fainted in the town square. I was worried.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	676	ei "[what]"
act2_b2e65d67	ke	Ah, yes! I invited Eisleigh over for lunch. Ilona, you probably haven't eaten at all yet, have you? You should try to eat, even if it's just a little.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	679	ke "[what]"
act2_e72bef98_3	il	…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	682	il "[what]"

act2_787c1582		Kellac serves Eisleigh and Ilona a rustic stew, with dark bread and clear water on the side. During the time eating together, Eisleigh asks about the investigation, and Ilona repeats Anari's reasoning surrounding Eisleigh and Kellac.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	692	"[what]"
act2_861fe889		Ilona thought that Anari's defence was unbreakable, but there was one new thing she learnt about last night…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	694	"[what]"
act2_bd132cf0	il	So are you considering the possibility someone tried to drug us during the banquet?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	704	il "[what]"
act2_75d56eb9	ke	That's what I feared, at least. Anari and I left before that, so I don't really have a clear picture of what exactly happened.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	707	ke "[what]"
act2_bac06f0b		Ilona stares at an empty teacup in the room and realizes something — if the tea she served Anari was different, but she used the same sugar from last night—	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	712	"[what]"
act2_4134c7c6	il	The sugar — it must have been tampered with! Last night, I didn't add any to my tea because I didn't want to be rude, but I took some when I had tea with Anari.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	715	il "[what]"
act2_89637066	ei	I remember Fleur was really insistent on putting sugar in my tea. I did think that was weird.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	718	ei "[what]"
act2_6b9f322d	ke	How much sugar did you put in your tea this morning, Ilona?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	721	ke "[what]"
act2_1c4e73e0	il	Four spoonfuls…	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	724	il "[what]"

act2_fe2eb6e7	ei	I think we can confirm this theory to be true then: someone was trying to put us into a deep sleep - and there's a chance they were trying to target Edwin specifically.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	733	ei "[what]"
act2_cd5dc58d	il	Then that would implicate Salome, or Fleur, most likely. They were the ones who prepared the tea last night.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	736	il "[what]"
act2_c7a44575	ei	It's not like I can deny it, but...	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	739	ei "[what]"
act2_992d9e4b	ke	Uldin could be involved, too.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	742	ke "[what]"

act2_37da9ee8	ke	I never inquired too closely about it, but he comes from a rather unscrupulous family; it wouldn't surprise me if he was aware of this plot.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	747	ke "[what]"
act2_14ccb059		Kellac seems to know the most about Uldin's family and his circumstances, so Ilona asked him for more information.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	751	"[what]"

act2_9ed3278a		Salome often handles the day to day affairs of managing Belorov. Uldin came back a day ago, and his return was welcomed back with a feast on All Hallows' Eve.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	758	"[what]"
act2_5534675e		On the topic of magic, Eisleigh recalls something that she needed to discuss.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	764	"[what]"

act2_bfc74a00	ei	Besides, there's always a risk involved in keeping that item safe — so it is better that only the bearer knows of it, because it could get lost, destroyed, or...	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	807	ei "[what]"
act2_0ff42dad	il	… stolen.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	810	il "[what]"
act2_851d31ba		Both Kellac and Ilona look at Eisleigh with tense faces. Ilona isn't sure what to be more surprised at: Eisleigh's incredible reasoning and knowledge, or that someone would go as far as to steal an item uncertain to be in Edwin's possession.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	813	"[what]"
act2_f8d26d7a	ei	There is a high chance that this cursed item still exists. Had it been destroyed, he would have died along with it.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	816	ei "[what]"
act2_32bcef57	ei	This would give us a reason as to why Edwin was drugged last night: Uldin and Salome are sharp, and they might have caught onto Edwin being a werewolf early on.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	819	ei "[what]"
act2_cd9c659d	il	If we return this item to Edwin, would it restore the transformed arms back to human form?	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	821	il "[what]"
act2_9a419297	ei	It's entirely possible, if that's what controls the transformation. A cursed item like that can generally only be bound to one person.	game/scripts/acts/act2.rpy	823	ei "[what]"

act3_83f73ac6	il	Salome must have screamed to clear suspicion from herself, and hid in the master's chamber. At that point, Edwin was looking for his stolen item. He broke down the door and found Fleur's body.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	581	il "[what]"

act3_c58a4fd8	il	I wouldn't be so quick to discount the possibility. We found a chest made for Fleur in Salome's room. When Eisleigh opened it, she suffered a horrific injury from a trap.

act3_e9a1d96a	il	In fact, since the letter was found still sealed, I would suspect Salome encouraged Fleur to write it. To make Fleur's disappearance seem more credible, she placed it in the forest after her escape.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	619	il "[what]"

act3_d2c2e98b	an	But unless you bring Salome to me, I will not be convinced. The ‘righteousness’ that you preach is meaningless without tangible proof. So, where is Salome? We searched everywhere in this town for her daughter.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	679	an "[what]"

act3_deeba605	il	You're blaming us for being caught in a plot that we had no part in? You have done nothing but look for reasons to kill Edwin all along. For all I know, maybe you planned for this to happen, to usurp power in Belorov.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	701	il "[what]"

act3_2a37e464		At Anari's signal, two town guards move in on Ilona and grip her arms tightly; drawing them behind her back. They bind Ilona's hands together with thick rope.	game/scripts/acts/act3.rpy	714	"[what]"
